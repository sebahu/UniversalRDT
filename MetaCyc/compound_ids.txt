The |FRAME: Jasmonates jasmonates| are a group of important phytohormones, structurally similar to animal |FRAME: Prostaglandins prostaglandins| and ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. Many forms exist, based on the structure of |FRAME: Jasmonic-Acids "Jasmonate"| (jasmonic acid, JA). The jasmonates act as regulatory molecules in many developmental processes that include fertility, sex determination, root elongation and fruit ripening. They are also potent signals activating plant defences against pathogens, herbivory, wounding and abiotic stress.

The jasmonate regulation system includes the COI1 receptor protein and several JAZ (<b>JA</b>smonate <b>Z</b>IM domain) repressors, which, in the absence of jasmonate, are bound to the MYC2 transcription factors, preventing transcription. In the presence of active jasmonate molecules, COI1 interacts with the JAZ repressors, causing their |FRAME: PWY-7511 ubiquitylation|. The ubiquitylated repressors are targeted for proteasome degradation, releasing the MYC2 transcription factors and activating transcription |CITS: [19716757]|.

Only two of the four stereoisomers of jasmonate occur naturally: |FRAME: CPD-731| and |FRAME: CPD-734| |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. These two forms are present in equilibrium within cells and can interconvert spontaneously through epimerization |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. The exact ratio of these stereoisomers within a cell has not been conclusively determined, and it may vary based on species, cell type, and physiological state. But, in the systems tested so far, |FRAME: CPD-734| is found at higher levels than |FRAME: CPD-731| |CITS:[19349968]|. The biological activity of these stereoisomers can be quite different |CITS: [8074303]|. In addition, enzymes involved in JA metabolism may have different preferences for the different stereoisomers |CITS: [17291501]|.

species |CITS: [SEMBDER93][17273867][18812165]|. This structure represents one of the two naturally occurring forms of
JA-Ile. Spontaneous epimerization allows interconversion between this compound and its stereoisomer,
|FRAME: CPD-11232| |CITS: [19349968]|.

In |FRAME: TAX-3702|, JA-Ile promotes binding between the COI1 F-box protein and the JAZ1 repressor involved in jasmonic acid-mediated signaling |CITS: [17637677]|. Therefore, JA-Ile promotes the degradation of JAZ1. Initial studies suggested that |FRAME: CPD-11232| was a biologically active phytohormone |CITS: [SEMBDER93][17291501]|. However,
later work shows that |FRAME: CPD-11259| is the biologically active form of the compound |CITS: [19349968
]|. This compound exists at low levels in most commercial preparations of |FRAME: CPD-11232| and may explain the observed biological activity originally associated with the trans diastereomer. A pure preparation of the latter compound does not promote JAZ/COI1 binding <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [19349968]|.

JA-Ile has also been detected in |FRAME: TAX-49451| and plays a role in defense responses in that organism |CITS: [17085687]|, but it is unclear which form of JA-Ile is active in this process.

It has been reported that, unlike JA-Ile, JA-Phe does not promote interaction between the JAZ1/JAZ3 and COI1 proteins from tomato <i>in vitro</i>. However, the compound used was mixture of synthetic (+)-JA-Phe and (-)-JA-Phe diastereomers, and did not include the naturally-occuring |FRAME: CPD-19817| |CITS: [18458331]|. 

|FRAME: CPD-11235| [(-)-JA-L-Phe] was tested for its activity in |FRAME: TAX-3702| using three different assays, and did not show any biological activity |CITS: [19349968]| (supplementary materials). On the other hand,  (-)-JA-L-Phe was reported to elicit strongly the biosynthesis of the phytoalexin |FRAME: CPD-7079| in rice |CITS:[9013895]|.

It is possible that the other stereoisomer, |FRAME: CPD-19817|, might have some biological activity (as is the case for |FRAME: CPD-11259| vs. |FRAME: CPD-11232|) |CITS: [19349968]|. JA-Phe and its hydroxylated derivatives have been shown to accumulate in |FRAME: TAX-3702| following leaf wounding or fungal infection, although the stereochemistry has not been taken into account in this study as well |CITS: [26164240]|.

complex sesquiterpenoids, higher terpenoids, and steroids for many years, and more recently many
other roles have been discovered for both the pyrophosphate form and the corresponding alcohol
farnesol.

For example, farnesol acts as a quorum-sensing molecule to suppress filamentation in the fungus
|FRAME: TAX-5476| |CITS: [12954333]|, and farnesyl derivatives are involved in the a-factor mating
peptide of the dodecapeptide pheromone found in |FRAME: TAX-4932| |CITS: [11112575]|.
Terpene alcohols such as farnesol have antibacterial effects against |FRAME: TAX-1280|,
including promotion of potassium ion leakage |CITS: [15321680]|.
Furthermore, FPP plays a pivotal role in the posttranslational processing of Ras proteins.

Farnesol has 4 isomers, the most abundant of which is |FRAME:2-TRANS6-TRANS-FARNESOL|
|CITS: [Yu05]|.

Even though the enzyme forming furaneol appears to produce the |FRAME: CPD-20130| isomer preferentially |CITS: [12840820]|, the compound occurs in the fruits as a racematic mixture |CITS: [Bruche91]|. The quick racemization at neutral pH is a result of rapid |FRAME: CPD-10198 keto|-|FRAME: CPD-10211 enol|-tautomerism |CITS: [12840820]|.

The naringenin and its glycosides content undergoes significant changes upon phytopathogen attack, and thus it appears that these compounds participate in the defense mechanism of |FRAME:TAX-2706| species and may act as fungicides |CITS: [15053528]|.

|FRAME: NARINGIN Naringin| has been investigated with respect to its ability to scavenge oxygen free radicals involved in the oxidation of hemoglobin |CITS: [12967034]|, lowering the plasma total cholesterol level |CITS: [14738906]| and blocking the cytotoxity and apoptosis of |FRAME: CPD-15099| (Ara-C), a chemotherapeutical drug used for acute leukemia |CITS: [15135655]|.

The bitterness of certain citrus species such as grapefruit (|FRAME:TAX-37656|), bitter orange (|FRAME:TAX-43166|) and pummelo (|FRAME:TAX-37334|) is caused by flavanone neohesperidosides such as naringin, in which a rhamnose is attached via the C-2 hydroxyl group of glucose. Flavanone rutinosides such as |FRAME: CPD-7059|, in which the L-rhamnose attached to the C-6 hydroxyl group of the glucose moiety, are tasteless and occur predominantly in sweet citrus fruits such as orange (|FRAME:TAX-2711|) and mandarin (<i>Citrus reticulata</i>) |CITS: [15361143]|.

CPD-20100

Several related compounds have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-20101|, |FRAME: CPD-13353| and |FRAME: CPD-20103|. The biological activity of these compounds, known collectively as oxyvinylglycines, is based on their ability to inhibit enzymes that require |FRAME: PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| as a co-factor |CITS: [Berkowitz06]|.
CPD-20101

The compound also inhibits L-methionine tRNA aminoacylation |CITS: [16660951]|, and was shown to inhibit the growth of important plant and animal pathogens such as |FRAME: TAX-552| |CITS: [23757135]| and |FRAME: TAX-1280| |CITS: [25814981]|.

Linalool is a primary compound in floral scent research. Both enantiomeric forms, |FRAME: CPD-8996| and |FRAME: CPD-8997|, occur in nature.

Linalool is involved as an attractant in plant interactions with pollinators, herbivores and parasitoids |CITS: [RAGUSO]|. It has also been shown to be induced by artificial wounding and by jasmonic acid |CITS: [17440821]|. The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of linalool has been demonstrated in floral tissues |CITS: [17440821]|, barks and roots |CITS: [RAGUSO]|. Junipers, dicots and monocots emit linalool along with other monoterpenoids |CITS: [RAGUSO]|.

Even though fungi typically do not produce monoterpenes, the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of linalool was demonstrate in some fungi, including the wine yeast strain, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> M522, in the absence of grape derived precursors |CITS: [15668008]|.

This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.

However, most folate molecules are further modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming
folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). Most of the glutamates are added by
&gamma;-carboxy-linked polyglutamylation via an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate
or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by
peptidases or proteases that are specific for  &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide  bonds.

The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.

The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.

Among the many folates |FRAME:5-FORMYL-THF "(6S)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate"| is the most enigmatic compound involved in the folate biosynthesis. |FRAME:5-FORMYL-THF| is the only folate derivative that does not serve as a cofactor in C1-metabolism, but it is the most frequent and stable form of folates found in plants |CITS: [8480361]|. Moreover, |FRAME:5-FORMYL-THF| is known to inhibit most of the folate dependent enzymes at physiological concentrations. The biological role of this compound is still poorly understood but it has been discussed as factor involved in the regulation of essential biosynthetic steps such as the formation of serine during photorespiration |CITS: [15888445][12207015]|.
5-FORMYL-THF

During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.

The structure of bilirubin-IX &alpha; was originally established by Hans Fischer in 1941, who did not specify the isomeric configuration |CITS: [Fischer41]|. It was later shown that the naturally occurring form of bilirubin is the |FRAME: BILIRUBIN "<i>Z,Z</i> isomer"| |CITS: [Lemberg49]|. However, when exposed to light, the Z,Z isomer converts to an |FRAME: CPD-20930 <i>E,E</i> isomer"|.

Unconjugated bilirubin is extremely water insoluble. It is carried (mostly by albumin) to the liver, where it is converted to glucuronides, which are water soluble. The glucuronides are eventually excreted in bile. Glucuronated forms include both monoglucuronides (a mixture of the two positional isomers |FRAME: CPD-20932| and |FRAME: BILIRUBIN-GLUCURONOSIDE|) and |FRAME: BILIRUBIN-BISGLUCURONOSIDE| |CITS: [5145912][949313][7378044]|.

Four basic forms of bilirubin are found in blood: |FRAME: BILIRUBIN "unconjugated bilirubin"| (&alpha; bilirubin), |FRAME: BILIRUBIN-GLUCURONOSIDE "mono-conjugated"| (&beta; bilirubin), |FRAME: BILIRUBIN-BISGLUCURONOSIDE "di-conjugated"| (&gamma; bilirubin), and protein bound (&delta; bilirubin) |CITS: [5902889]|.

Amphetamine is not a natural product. It was first synthesized in 1887 under the name phenylisopropylamine, but at the time its effect on the nervous system was not known. It was independently resynthesized in 1927, at which time its sympathomimetic properties were reported. Most of the currently prescribed amphetamine formulations contain both enantiomers.

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for pain relief, fever reduction, and against swelling.

Like other NSAID drugs, ibuprofen works by inhibiting the enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.14.99.1| (also known as cyclooxygenase or COX) that converts |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| to |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2|, which normally is converted to other prostaglandins that mediate pain, inflammation, and fever. In addition, |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2| is also a precursor of |FRAME: ALPHA11-ALPHA-EPOXY-15-HYDROXYTHROMBA|, which stimulates platelet aggregation, thus the use of NSAID drugs also reduces the formation of blood clots. Ibuprofen inhibits both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, |FRAME: HS01815| (COX1) and |FRAME: HS01115| (COX-2).

The active form of ibuprofen is |FRAME: CPD-15516|. The drug is synthesized as a racemic mixture, but an isomerase encoded by the |FRAME: HS01416| gene converts the inactive |FRAME: CPD-15517 "(R)-form"| to the active form via a coenzyme A derivative |CITS: [9106621]|.

Ibuprofen was derived from propanoate during the 1960s. Originally marketed as Brufen, ibuprofen is available under a variety of popular trademarks, including Motrin, Nurofen, Advil, Nuprin and many others.

The enzyme complexes that require lipoate have a dedicated lipoyl domain, and lipoate is actually produced on this domain. The precursor |FRAME: CPD-195| molecule is first attached to a specific |FRAME: LYS| residue within the lipoyl domain, and is then converted to lipoate by the enzyme lipoyl synthase, which is also the source of the two sulfur atoms.

Lipoate can be detached from the enzyme complex by a dedicated lipoamidase, and be re-attached to the complex by the enzyme lipoate protein ligase.

Studies in the 1950s have shown that |FRAME: EC-1.2.1.12|, slowly catalyzes the formation of NADHX from NADH |CITS: [Rafter54]|. The equilibrium of this hydration reaction is in favor (100/1) of the hydrated form |CITS: [3061454]|, making the reaction virtually irreversible.

NADHX and NADPHX are inhibitors of several dehydrogenases |CITS: [ 9851831]| and it is thus important to eliminate them. Reconversion of NADHX to NADH is catalyzed by an |FRAME: ENSG00000153481-MONOMER "ATP-dependent dehydratase"| |CITS:[239637][21994945]|.

Linalools

Linalool is a primary compound in floral scent research. Both enantiomeric forms, |FRAME: CPD-8996| and |FRAME: CPD-8997|, occur in nature.

Linalool is involved as an attractant in plant interactions with pollinators, herbivores and parasitoids |CITS: [RAGUSO]|. It has also been shown to be induced by artificial wounding and by jasmonic acid |CITS: [17440821]|. The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of linalool has been demonstrated in floral tissues |CITS: [17440821]|, barks and roots |CITS: [RAGUSO]|. Junipers, dicots and monocots emit linalool along with other monoterpenoids |CITS: [RAGUSO]|.

Even though fungi typically do not produce monoterpenes, the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of linalool was demonstrate in some fungi, including the wine yeast strain, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> M522, in the absence of grape derived precursors |CITS: [15668008]|.

Amphetamine is not a natural product. It was first synthesized in 1887 under the name phenylisopropylamine, but at the time its effect on the nervous system was not known. It was independently resynthesized in 1927, at which time its sympathomimetic properties were reported. Most of the currently prescribed amphetamine formulations contain both enantiomers.

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for pain relief, fever reduction, and against swelling.

Like other NSAID drugs, ibuprofen works by inhibiting the enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.14.99.1| (also known as cyclooxygenase or COX) that converts |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| to |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2|, which normally is converted to other prostaglandins that mediate pain, inflammation, and fever. In addition, |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2| is also a precursor of |FRAME: ALPHA11-ALPHA-EPOXY-15-HYDROXYTHROMBA|, which stimulates platelet aggregation, thus the use of NSAID drugs also reduces the formation of blood clots. Ibuprofen inhibits both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, |FRAME: HS01815| (COX1) and |FRAME: HS01115| (COX-2).

The active form of ibuprofen is |FRAME: CPD-15516|. The drug is synthesized as a racemic mixture, but an isomerase encoded by the |FRAME: HS01416| gene converts the inactive |FRAME: CPD-15517 "(R)-form"| to the active form via a coenzyme A derivative |CITS: [9106621]|.

Ibuprofen was derived from propanoate during the 1960s. Originally marketed as Brufen, ibuprofen is available under a variety of popular trademarks, including Motrin, Nurofen, Advil, Nuprin and many others.

Studies in the 1950s have shown that |FRAME: EC-1.2.1.12|, slowly catalyzes the formation of NADHX from NADH |CITS: [Rafter54]|. The equilibrium of this hydration reaction is in favor (100/1) of the hydrated form |CITS: [3061454]|, making the reaction virtually irreversible.

NADHX and NADPHX are inhibitors of several dehydrogenases |CITS: [ 9851831]| and it is thus important to eliminate them. Reconversion of NADHX to NADH is catalyzed by an |FRAME: ENSG00000153481-MONOMER "ATP-dependent dehydratase"| |CITS:[239637][21994945]|.

NICOTINE

Nicotine is the addictive compound in tobacco |CITS: [8301571]| and is a commonly used psychoactive drug. It enters the body by systemic absorption through the smoking or chewing of tobacco products |CITS: [6705448][10224986]|.
In cigarette smoke nicotine is carried on particulate matter and is rapidly absorbed in the small airways and alveoli of the lung |CITS: [11712903]|. In this neutral pH environment it is un-ionized, soluble, and can be transferred across cell membranes and into the blood, where it moves into the pulmonary venous circulation, to the left ventricle of the heart, and into the systemic arterial circulation |CITS: [8646831][10482401]|. Within seconds nicotine travels to the brain, where it binds to nicotinic cholinergic receptors and activates the dopaminergic reward system |CITS: [10336551]| (and reviewed in |CITS: [8725403]|).  

Other forms of nicotine (such as nicotine gum, transdermal patches, inhalers, lozenges, and sublingual tablets) are usually buffered at alkaline pH and quickly traverse cell membranes, but most reach the blood and brain more slowly. They are less likely to cause addiction due to the delayed reward |CITS: [3391001][8245272][15734728]|.

BILIRUBIN

The structure of bilirubin-IX &alpha; was originally established by Hans Fischer in 1941, who did not specify the isomeric configuration |CITS: [Fischer41]|. It was later shown that the naturally occurring form of bilirubin is the |FRAME: BILIRUBIN "<i>Z,Z</i> isomer"| |CITS: [Lemberg49]|. However, when exposed to light, the Z,Z isomer converts to an |FRAME: CPD-20930 <i>E,E</i> isomer"|.

Unconjugated bilirubin is extremely water insoluble. It is carried (mostly by albumin) to the liver, where it is converted to glucuronides, which are water soluble. The glucuronides are eventually excreted in bile. Glucuronated forms include both monoglucuronides (a mixture of the two positional isomers |FRAME: CPD-20932| and |FRAME: BILIRUBIN-GLUCURONOSIDE|) and |FRAME: BILIRUBIN-BISGLUCURONOSIDE| |CITS: [5145912][949313][7378044]|.

Four basic forms of bilirubin are found in blood: |FRAME: BILIRUBIN "unconjugated bilirubin"| (&alpha; bilirubin), |FRAME: BILIRUBIN-GLUCURONOSIDE "mono-conjugated"| (&beta; bilirubin), |FRAME: BILIRUBIN-BISGLUCURONOSIDE "di-conjugated"| (&gamma; bilirubin), and protein bound (&delta; bilirubin) |CITS: [5902889]|.

1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentene anion.  1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentene anion, an aci-reductone, is believed to be an unstable 
intermediate in the methionine salvage pathway in 
|FRAME:TAX-573|.  Although this compound is not synonymous with the pentane, 
1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentane, the database should keep this name as a synonym
since a previous database version of the methionine salvage pathway and the abstract in
|CITS: [7852397]| referred to this intermediate as the pentane.  Reference to this intermediate as a
pentane in the abstract of |CITS: [7852397]| was most likely a typo |CITS: [pochapsky02]|, which 
was then promulgated into the pathway of the database.  The pathway has been corrected since then.

Enterobacter, Klebsiella and Lactobacillus species, via the fermentation of |FRAME: GLYCEROL|.
A common problem with anaerobic growth is the generation of excess reducing equivalents in the form of NADH, whose reoxidation to NAD+ requires formation of a by-product that can serve as an electron sink. In the case of glycerol, the process comprises two steps - the rearrangement of glycerol to |FRAME: HYDROXYPROPANAL|, followed by its NADH-dependent reduction to |FRAME: CPD-347|, which is excreted from the cell.

PDO is used for the production of poly(propylene terephtalate), a polyester prepared from |FRAME: TEREPHTHALATE| and PDO that has highly desired properties for some large volume markets (such as fibers used in apparel and carpet applications).

15-ANHYDRO-D-GLUCITOL
is generally found in animals and plants, and is inert in these organisms (some bacteria and fungi are able to metabolize it. ). Its physiological role is unknown. Most of the |FRAME: 15-ANHYDRO-D-GLUCITOL| found in animal blood is derived from food.

The level of |FRAME: 15-ANHYDRO-D-GLUCITOL| in human body fluid is used as a sensitive marker for glycemic control in the diagnosis of diabetes, since the plasma level of this compound decreases dramatically in diabetes patients. The lower levels in diabetic patients are thought to be due to competitive inhibition of the reabsorption of the compound at the renal proximal tubuli by a glucose transporter in the presence of excess glucose in the glomerular filtrate |CITS: [7287673][6345028][2656341][16276006]|. |FRAME: 15-ANHYDRO-D-GLUCITOL| can also act as a marker for coronary artery disease |CITS: [24679905]|.

It is formed in the brain from |FRAME: CPD-22665| by the enzyme MAO-B, ultimately causing parkinsonism in primates by killing certain dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra. The ability for MPP+ to induce Parkinson's disease has made it an important compound in Parkinson's research.

The melleolides are one of the largest fungal natural product families with more than 60 structural variants. Modifications of the basic structure include hydroxylation at various positions of the sesquiterpene, oxidation of the primary alcohol at C-1 to an aldehyde or carboxy group, shift or reduction of the cyclohexene double bond, methyl ether formation at O-5', and chlorination at C-6' |CITS: [26655762]|.

During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.

However, most folate molecules are further modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming
folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). Most of the glutamates are added by
&gamma;-carboxy-linked polyglutamylation via an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate
or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by
peptidases or proteases that are specific for  &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide  bonds.

The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.

The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.

|FRAME: CPD-13548| is naturally generated in the body, yet it has a 100-fold lower affinity to the nuclear retinoic acid receptors than |FRAME: RETINOATE| or |FRAME: CPD-13549|, and it does not bind to retinoid x-receptors. Thus, the mechanism of action of |FRAME: CPD-13548| is still unclear.

It has been suggested that |FRAME: CPD-13548| modulates brain neurochemical systems because increased levels are correlated with depression and increased suicidal tendencies |CITS: [17707566]|.

|FRAME: CPD-352| is the predominant estrogen in non-pregenant women during their reproductive years in terms of serum levels. |FRAME: ESTRONE Estrone| is the predominant circulating estrogen in women during menopause and |FRAME: ESTRIOL| is the predominant circulating estrogen during pregnancy.

17&beta;-estradiol is also present in males at roughly the same concentration as in postmenopausal women. It is produced as an active metabolic product of testosterone.

In premenapausal women 17&beta;-estradiol is produced by the granulosa cells of the ovaries by the aromatization of |FRAME: ANDROST4ENE| (via |FRAME: ESTRONE|). The same occurs in men in the testes. In addition, 17&beta;-estradiol is produced from |FRAME: TESTOSTERONE|.

|FRAME: CPD-8052|, as a component of IPGs, is more important than |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, since the IPGs functioning as the insulin mediators contain |FRAME: CPD-8052| exclusively |CITS: [2833261]|.

A defect in <i>in vivo</i> |FRAME: CPD-8052| production was elucidated in insulin-sensitive tissue of type 2 diabetic rats showing insulin resistance |CITS: [11900279]|. In addition, |FRAME: CPD-8052| is either absent or found at a low concentration in urine and muscle biopsy mediator samples in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with control subjects |CITS: [2370888]|. Thus, |FRAME: CPD-8052| was proposed as a drug candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes |CITS: [16461681]|.

In addition, the administration of |FRAME: CPD-8052| to women with the polycystic ovary syndrome has been shown to reduce circulating insulin, decrease serum androgens, ameliorate some of the metabolic abnormalities (increased blood pressure and hypertriglyceridemia), and promote ovulation |CITS: [15251831]|.

D-MYO-INOSITOL-1-MONOPHOSPHATE

|FRAME: 1-L-MYO-INOSITOL-1-P "1L-<i>myo</i>-inositol 1-phosphate"| is the compound formed from glucose 6-phosphate in the biosynthesis of inositol.

|FRAME: D-MYO-INOSITOL-1-MONOPHOSPHATE| is the constituent of phospholipids and inositol polyphosphates.

Please note that 1L-<i>myo</i>-inositol 1-phosphate is also called 1D-<i>myo</i>-inositol 3-phosphate.

IMIDAZOLE-RING

Imidazole also exists in two equivalent tautomeric forms, |FRAME: IMIDAZOLE-RING| and |FRAME: CPD-19703|. Different numbering systems have been used leading to confusion in the naming of imidazole compounds. When a side chain exists (as in L-histidine), the nitrogen atoms of the ring are denoted by <i>pros</i> ('near', abbreviated &pi;) and <i>tele</i> ('far', abbreviated T) to show their position relative to the side chain.

When a substituent is introduced at positions 4 or 5, the tautomeric character of the molecule precludes a definite numbering of these positions, resulting in names in the form "4(or 5)-substituted imidazole", as in |FRAME: CPD-54 "4(or 5)-aminoimidazole"|. However, when the imino hydrogen is substituted, tautomerism is no longer possible, and the numbering of positions 4 and 5 becomes absolute, as in |FRAME: CPD-19704|.

CPD-8055

Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering.

Additional information on the nomenclature of <i>myo</i>-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document <A href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf">Nomenclature of cyclitols</A> by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication <A href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html">Numbering of atoms in <i>myo</i>-inositol</A>, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication.

To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathways (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.64"|).

2,4-Dinitrophenol is a well known protonophore (an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation) by preventing the uptake of inorganic phosphate molecules into the mitochondria |CITS: [18910739][4388239][5799112]|. At lower concentrations this property causes a significant increase in the basal metabolic rate, and as aresult, a rapid weight loss, which prompted its use as weight loss drug. However, severe side effects have resulted in its labelling as "extremely dangerous and not fit for human consumption" by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938. The UK Food Standard Agency issued a warning in 2003, labelling it as "not fit for human consumption" as well. Despite this, |FRAME: CPD-8179| is still marketed as a weight loss drug, mainly over the internet |CITS: [21739343]|.

It has been reported that at low concentrations |FRAME: CPD-8179| protects neurons against &beta;-amyloid toxicity |CITS: [16754295]| and attenuates nitroprusside-induced toxicity |CITS: [24064327]|.

complex sesquiterpenoids, higher terpenoids, and steroids for many years, and more recently many
other roles have been discovered for both the pyrophosphate form and the corresponding alcohol
farnesol.

For example, farnesol acts as a quorum-sensing molecule to suppress filamentation in the fungus
|FRAME: TAX-5476| |CITS: [12954333]|, and farnesyl derivatives are involved in the a-factor mating
peptide of the dodecapeptide pheromone found in |FRAME: TAX-4932| |CITS: [11112575]|.
Terpene alcohols such as farnesol have antibacterial effects against |FRAME: TAX-1280|,
including promotion of potassium ion leakage |CITS: [15321680]|.
Furthermore, FPP plays a pivotal role in the posttranslational processing of Ras proteins.

Farnesol has 4 isomer, the most abundant of which is |FRAME:2-TRANS6-TRANS-FARNESOL|
|CITS: [Yu05]|.

In most plants the accumulation of ABA appears to be a signal for other processes.

In seeds, ABA plays a dual role in embryo growth during developmen. In early embryogenesis ABA prevents seed abortion and promotes embryo growth |CITS: [12417697][14716564]|. In contrast, during late embryogenesis, when the hormone level increases, ABA blocks the embryo growth by counteracting the action of gibberellin to promote germination |CITS: [10759503][11124119]|.

In other tissues ABA-mediated signalling plays an important part in plant responses to environmental stress and plant pathogens, such as development of desiccation tolerance |CITS:[10611388][11842158][11779861][12221975]|, suppression of vivipary |CITS: [10753527][11124119][15363412]|, and water stress-induced closure of stomata |CITS: [11559734][12834401]|.

In plants, abscisic acid is synthesized from C40 carotenoids. The C15 backbone of ABA is formed after the oxidative cleavage of |FRAME: CPD1F-135|, and the final molecule is formed by two additional reactions, a dehydrogenase and an oxidoreductase, as described in this pathway |CITS: [12692318][15862093]|.

In some plant pathogenic fungi ABA is synthesized a different biosynthetic route that involves the direct cyclization of C15 terpenoid (sesquiterpene) |CITS: [10945263][11129578][15618629][15464154][15240257]|.

|FRAME: Lipid-A "Lipid A"| consists of two glucosamine units with four to six attached acyl chains, and normally one phosphate group on each of the glucosamines. Four &beta; hydroxy acyl chains, 10 to 16 carbons in length, are attached directly to the glucosamine sugars. Two additional acyl chains are often attached to the beta hydroxy group of two of the four  &beta; hydroxy acyl chains.

The lipid As found in |FRAME: TAX-382| and other rhizobia, as well as Brucella species, are modified with very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). Several forms of VLCFAs can be found in these lipids, including |FRAME: CPD-18269|, |FRAME: CPD-18268|, and |FRAME: CPD-18270| |CITS: [1854635][15044696][21454518]|.

Since the full structure of lipid A is assembled only when attached to the core oligosaccharide, a "stand alone" lipid A, as depicted here, does not occur naturally.

Polythioesters are microbially-synthesized, non-biodegradable polymers containing sulfur in the thioester linkages of the backbone |CITS: [15762657]|. They accumulate as hydrophobic inclusions in the cytoplasm of bacterial cells, similarly to |FRAME: Polyhydroxyalkanoates "polyhydroxyalkanoic acids"| (PHAs) |CITS: [15468206]|.
PHAs and PTEs are industrially and scientifically interesting materials because they possess some unique characteristics regarding their biodegradability, microstructure, thermal behaviour and diverse mechanical properties, and because many of them can be produced from nonpetrochemical resources.

PTE heteropolymers were first detected in |FRAME: TAX-106590| |CITS: [11160796]|. That organism naturally accumulates PHAs at levels of up to more than 90% of the cell dry matter. When given |FRAME: CPD-7673|, |FRAME: CPD-16592|, |FRAME: CPD-16591|, |FRAME: CPD-16587| or |FRAME: CPD-16586| (in addition to a second compound that serves as a carbon and energy source) its unspecific |FRAME: CPLX-7357| produces various PTE heteropolymers.

While PTE polymers are structural analogs of common cell metabolites, only few bacteria are able to degrade them |CITS: [15762657][16738107][19001372]|.

Much of the knowledge about bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis comes from the organisms |FRAME: TAX-1061| and |FRAME: TAX-1063|, which produce mainly |FRAME:CPD-9067|, the most common form of the bacteriochlorophylls.

Most of the bacteria that synthesize bacteriochlorophyll are anoxygenic species that belong to the proteobacteria. They are also known as purple bacteria, due to the color of the pigment. These species photosynthesize only under anaerobic conditions. However, bacteriochlorophylls are also present in some groups of aerobic bacteria, such as members of the Acidiphilium genus |CITS: [Wakao93]|. For a complete list of aerobic bacteria that contain bacteriochlorophyll, see |CITS: [12483616]|.

BMAA was shown to inhibit nitrogen fixation |CITS: [23966039][29624906]|, and its production and secretion into the environment may be a mechanism for nitrogen non-fixing strains to compete with nitrogen-fixers under nitrogen starvation |CITS: [31812811]|. 

BMAA is a powerful neurotoxin in mammals that can cross the blood-brain barrier. In high concentrations it can cause motor neuron dysfunction and death |CITS: [2551452][17098435]|. In lower doses it appears to promote the development of a number of neurodegenerative diseases of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/Parkinsonism dementia complex |CITS: [28540663]|. MBAA is found in brains of neurodegenerative disease patients in a protein-bound form |CITS: [29235019]|.

KDO

In bacteria Kdo is a part of the inner core of lipopolysaccharides. In the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-562| it is added to the lipid A precursor |FRAME: LIPID-IV-A| |CITS: [1577828]|, while in |FRAME: TAX-287| it is added directly to fully acylated |FRAME: Lipid-A "lipid A"| |CITS: [2833499]|.

In most, but not all, bacteria two Kdo units are added to a lipid molecule (see |FRAME: KDOSYN-PWY|). In some organisms such as |FRAME: TAX-727|, |FRAME: TAX-666| and |FRAME: TAX-520| only one Kdo residue is incorporated (see |FRAME: PWY-7675|), while lipopolysaccharides from members of the |FRAME: TAX-810| genus incorporate three Kdo units (see |FRAME: PWY-6467|). |FRAME: TAX-22| species incorporate an |FRAME: CPD-18063 "aminated form of Kdo"| (see |FRAME: PWY-7676|), while in |FRAME: TAX-469|, |FRAME: TAX-632| and |FRAME: TAX-615| one of the two Kdo units is replaced by |FRAME: CPD-18119| (D-glycero-D-talo-oct-2-ulopynosonate).

When multiple Kdo units are incorporated, they are added by different linkages. The first unit is always added by a (2->6) glycosidic linkage, the second one by a (2->4) linkage, and the third one by a (2->8) linkage.

PANTETHEINE-P

The free thiol moiety of |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| serves to covalently bind the acyl reaction intermediates as thioesters during the multistep assembly of the monomeric precursors, typically acetyl, malonyl, and aminoacyl groups |CITS: [11489886]|.

The |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| moiety is derived from coenzyme A (CoA) and posttranslationally transferred onto an invariant serine side chain by |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.7|, as described by this equation:

|FRAME: HOLO-ACP-SYNTH-RXN|

Organisms often have several such enzymes; for example, |FRAME:TAX-562| have three enzymes, encoded by the |FRAME: EG10247|, |FRAME: EG10262| and |FRAME: EG12221| genes.

GABA was originally discovered in plants in 1949 |CITS: [Steward49]|, but interest shifted to animals when it was
found that GABA occurs at high levels in the brain, as a neurotransmitter.
In plants and in animals, GABA is mainly metabolized via a short pathway composed of three enzymes,
called the GABA shunt because it bypasses two steps of the |FRAME: TCA|.

Imidazole also exists in two equivalent tautomeric forms, |FRAME: IMIDAZOLE-RING| and |FRAME: CPD-19703|. Different numbering systems have been used leading to confusion in the naming of imidazole compounds. When a side chain exists (as in L-histidine), the nitrogen atoms of the ring are denoted by <i>pros</i> ('near', abbreviated &pi;) and <i>tele</i> ('far', abbreviated T) to show their position relative to the side chain.

When a substituent is introduced at positions 4 or 5, the tautomeric character of the molecule precludes a definite numbering of these positions, resulting in names in the form "4(or 5)-substituted imidazole", as in |FRAME: CPD-54 "4(or 5)-aminoimidazole"|. However, when the imino hydrogen is substituted, tautomerism is no longer possible, and the numbering of positions 4 and 5 becomes absolute, as in |FRAME: CPD-19704|.

Imidazole also exists in two equivalent tautomeric forms, |FRAME: IMIDAZOLE-RING| and |FRAME: CPD-19703|. Different numbering systems have been used leading to confusion in the naming of imidazole compounds. When a side chain exists (as in L-histidine), the nitrogen atoms of the ring are denoted by <i>pros</i> ('near', abbreviated &pi;) and <i>tele</i> ('far', abbreviated T) to show their position relative to the side chain.

When a substituent is introduced at positions 4 or 5, the tautomeric character of the molecule precludes a definite numbering of these positions, resulting in names in the form "4(or 5)-substituted imidazole", as in |FRAME: CPD-54 "4(or 5)-aminoimidazole"|. However, when the imino hydrogen is substituted, tautomerism is no longer possible, and the numbering of positions 4 and 5 becomes absolute, as in |FRAME: CPD-19704|.

During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.

However, most folate molecules are further modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming
folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). Most of the glutamates are added by
&gamma;-carboxy-linked polyglutamylation via an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate
or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by
peptidases or proteases that are specific for  &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide  bonds.

The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.

The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.

The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.

During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.

However, most folate molecules are further modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming
folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). Most of the glutamates are added by
&gamma;-carboxy-linked polyglutamylation via an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate
or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by
peptidases or proteases that are specific for  &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide  bonds.

|FRAME: CPD-13166| was first identified in 1994 as a component of |FRAME: TAX-66976| (the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease) LPS |CITS: [8168511]|, and subsequently reported from several other organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-294| strain ATCC 49271 |CITS: [8901267]|, |FRAME: TAX-40269| |CITS: [8766209]|, |FRAME: TAX-663| |CITS: [1707620]|, and |FRAME: TAX-470| |CITS: [9428717]|.

Imidazole also exists in two equivalent tautomeric forms, |FRAME: IMIDAZOLE-RING| and |FRAME: CPD-19703|. Different numbering systems have been used leading to confusion in the naming of imidazole compounds. When a side chain exists (as in L-histidine), the nitrogen atoms of the ring are denoted by <i>pros</i> ('near', abbreviated &pi;) and <i>tele</i> ('far', abbreviated T) to show their position relative to the side chain.

When a substituent is introduced at positions 4 or 5, the tautomeric character of the molecule precludes a definite numbering of these positions, resulting in names in the form "4(or 5)-substituted imidazole", as in |FRAME: CPD-54 "4(or 5)-aminoimidazole"|. However, when the imino hydrogen is substituted, tautomerism is no longer possible, and the numbering of positions 4 and 5 becomes absolute, as in |FRAME: CPD-19704|.

The enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of PRPP, |FRAME: EC-2.7.6.1|, is ubiquitous among free-living organisms. So far, only certain obligate intracellular parasites such as some |FRAME: TAX-810| and |FRAME: TAX-780| species are known to lack the gene encoding it. Mammals contain three PRPP synthase-encoding genes, the yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| contains five, and the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| contains five genes as well |CITS: [28031352]|.

The authors used the name FO to describe the fluorescent spot observed after electrophoresis was used to separate it from fator F<sub>420</sub>, and the name persisted (although some publications have subsequently used the incorrect names Fo and F<sub>0</sub>).

In 1982 it was reported that "cosynthetic factor I" and "FO" were the same compound |CITS: [McCormick82]|. Later it was found that the compound participates as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of |FRAME: Factor-420 "fator F<sub>420</sub>"| |CITS: [11948155][12013276][Graham03]|.

In addition to being an intermediate in the biosynthesis of |FRAME: Factor-420 "fator F<sub>420</sub>"|, |FRAME: CPD-7602| is also a cofactor of several forms of |FRAME: EC-4.1.99.3| |CITS: [ 12797829]|.

Cylindrospermopsin has hepatotoxic |CITS: [Ohtani92]|, general cytotoxic |CITS: [11961219]|, and neurotoxic |CITS: [11879784]| effects and is a potential carcinogen |CITS: [11113708][20725938][23966038]|. It can damage the liver, thymus, kidney, and heart |CITS: [7940590]|. Its toxicity is due to the inhibition of glutathione and protein synthesis as well as the inhibition of cytochrome P450 |CITS: [8198579][7840799][12900943][17949769]|.

The chemical structure of |FRAME: CPD-18452| was reported in 1992. It is is a polyketide-derived alkaloid with a central functional guanidino moiety and a hydroxymethyluracil attached to the tricyclic carbon skeleton |CITS: [Ohtani92]|.

Bulgecins
Butirosins

The butirosins are unique among naturally occurring aminoglycosides since they contain an (<i>S</i>)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyrate (AHBA) side-chain at the C-1 amine of the central 2-deoxystreptamine ring. This modification has been shown to confer resistance against several aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (the C-1 amine is a frequent target of aminoglycoside N-acyltransferases). As a result, the butirosins are active toward many aminoglycoside-resistant strains.

Although the butirosins are not themselves clinically useful drugs, the properties of their side-chain have led to successful synthetic alteration of |FRAME: CPD-4822| and |FRAME: CPD-14161| to produce |FRAME: CPD-14197| and |FRAME: CPD-14162|, respectively |CITS: [62814][Watanabe87a]|.

DOLICHOL

The length of dolichol molecules varies within a range in a species, and the range varies among species (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|). In mammals dolichols are usually within the range of 80 to 105 carbons. Archaea prefer dolichols of 55-60 carbons.

The main function of dolychols is to act as a membrane anchor for the formation of oligosaccharides, which are then transferred to certain asparagine residues within proteins through a modification process known as |FRAME: MANNOSYL-CHITO-DOLICHOL-BIOSYNTHESIS "N-glycosylation"|. In eukaryotes dolichol is also involved in the transfer of some of the monosaccharides to the forming oligosaccharide.

Dolichols are the major lipid component (14% by mass) of human substantia nigra |FRAME: CPD-12419| |CITS: [15686500]|.

The structure shown here is of a C80 dolichol, containing 16 isoprene units.

|FRAME: DOLICHOLP "Dolichyl phosphate"| acts as a membrane-bound carrier in the assembly of pyrophosphate-linked oligosaccharides. It can accept the respective sugar residues from the donors |FRAME: UDP-N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE|, |FRAME: CPD-12575| and |FRAME: GDP-MANNOSE|. When the complete oligosaccharide is transferred to a protein L-asparagine residue, |FRAME: Dolichol-PP| is produced. It can be converted back to |FRAME: DOLICHOLP| by |FRAME: EC-3.6.1.43|.

Farnesoates
Farnesols
complex sesquiterpenoids, higher terpenoids, and steroids for many years, and more recently many
other roles have been discovered for both the pyrophosphate form and the corresponding alcohol
farnesol.

For example, farnesol acts as a quorum-sensing molecule to suppress filamentation in the fungus
|FRAME: TAX-5476| |CITS: [12954333]|, and farnesyl derivatives are involved in the a-factor mating
peptide of the dodecapeptide pheromone found in |FRAME: TAX-4932| |CITS: [11112575]|.
Terpene alcohols such as farnesol have antibacterial effects against |FRAME: TAX-1280|,
including promotion of potassium ion leakage |CITS: [15321680]|.
Furthermore, FPP plays a pivotal role in the posttranslational processing of Ras proteins.

Jasmonic-Acids

The jasmonate regulation system includes the COI1 receptor protein and several JAZ (<b>JA</b>smonate <b>Z</b>IM domain) repressors, which, in the absence of jasmonate, are bound to the MYC2 transcription factors, preventing transcription. In the presence of active jasmonate molecules, COI1 interacts with the JAZ repressors, causing their |FRAME: PWY-7511 ubiquitylation|. The ubiquitylated repressors are targeted for proteasome degradation, releasing the MYC2 transcription factors and activating transcription |CITS: [19716757]|.

Only two of the four stereoisomers of jasmonate occur naturally: |FRAME: CPD-731| and |FRAME: CPD-734| |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. These two forms are present in equilibrium within cells and can interconvert spontaneously through epimerization |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. The exact ratio of these stereoisomers within a cell has not been conclusively determined, and it may vary based on species, cell type, and physiological state. But, in the systems tested so far, |FRAME: CPD-734| is found at higher levels than |FRAME: CPD-731| |CITS:[19349968]|. The biological activity of these stereoisomers can be quite different |CITS: [8074303]|. In addition, enzymes involved in JA metabolism may have different preferences for the different stereoisomers |CITS: [17291501]|.
Jasmonoyl-ACCs
The biological significance of this compound remains unknown. High levels of JA-ACC can affect root elongation in
Arabidopsis thaliana |CITS: [15258265]|. This appears to depend on a functional ethylene signaling pathway, but it does not require
the COI1 JA-signaling component |CITS: [15258265]|. Treatment of the Japanese weed, <i>Polygonum longisetum</i>,
with exogenous JA-ACC, increases sesquiterpene production in the leaves |CITS: [TAMOGAMI07]|.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, JA-Ile promotes binding between the COI1 F-box protein and the JAZ1 repressor involved
in jasmonic acid-mediated signaling |CITS: [17637677]|. Therefore, JA-Ile promotes the degradation of JAZ1.
Initial studies suggested that |FRAME: CPD-11232 "(-)-JA-Ile"| was a biologically active phytohormone
|CITS: [SEMBDER93][17291501]|. However,
later work shows that |FRAME: CPD-11259| is the biologically active form of the compound |CITS: [19349968
]|. This compound exists at low levels in most commercial preparations of |FRAME: CPD-11232| and may explain the observed
biological activity originally associated with |FRAME: CPD-11232 "(-)-JA-Ile"|. A pure preparation of that stereoisomer
does not promote JAZ/COI1 binding <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [19349968]|.

JA-Ile has also been detected in |FRAME: TAX-49451| and plays a role in defense responses |CITS: [17085687]|
but it is unclear which
form of JA-Ile is active in this process.

JA-Leu may not be a biologically active form of the hormone in all species. It does not appear to function in herbivory
defense responses in |FRAME: TAX-49451| |CITS: [18065562]|. The |FRAME: CPD-11234| isomer also does not affect seedling root
growth in Arabidopsis thaliana nor does it promote JAZ/COI1 interactions <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [19349968]|.
However, JA-Leu can elicit phytoalexin production in rice |CITS:[9013895]|.
Jasmonoyl-Phenylalanines
of this compound exist in plants - |FRAME: CPD-11235| and |FRAME: CPD-19817| |CITS: [19349968]|.

It has been reported that, unlike JA-Ile, JA-Phe does not promote interaction between the JAZ1/JAZ3 and COI1 proteins from tomato <i>in vitro</i>. However, the compound used was mixture of synthetic (+)-JA-Phe and (-)-JA-Phe diastereomers, and did not include the naturally-occuring |FRAME: CPD-19817| |CITS: [18458331]|. 

|FRAME: CPD-11235| [(-)-JA-L-Phe] was tested for its activity in |FRAME: TAX-3702| using three different assays, and did not show any biological activity |CITS: [19349968]| (supplementary materials). On the other hand,  (-)-JA-L-Phe was reported to elicit strongly the biosynthesis of the phytoalexin |FRAME: CPD-7079| in rice |CITS:[9013895]|.

It is possible that the other stereoisomer, |FRAME: CPD-19817|, might have some biological activity (as is the case for |FRAME: CPD-11259| vs. |FRAME: CPD-11232|) |CITS: [19349968]|. JA-Phe and its hydroxylated derivatives have been shown to accumulate in |FRAME: TAX-3702| following leaf wounding or fungal infection, although the stereochemistry has not been taken into account in this study as well |CITS: [26164240]|.

JA-Val may not be a biologically active form of the hormone in some species. It does not appear to function in herbivory

|FRAME: Phycoerythrobilins Phycoerythrobiln| is covalently linked to both subunits of the phycobiliprotein |FRAME: Phycoerythrins phycoerythrin| by a thioether bond to conserved cysteine resudues at position 84.
Phycourobilins

Phycourobilin is the major phycobilin of |FRAME: TAX-1117| living in oceanic areas where blue light penetrates deeply into the water column. It is covalently linked  to some forms of the phycobiliproteins |FRAME: Phycoerythrins phycoerythrin| and |FRAME: Phycocyanins phycocyanin| by a thioether bond to conserved cysteine residues.

Plastoquinols

Plastoquinones also serve as cofactors involved in the desaturation of phytoene in the synthesis of carotenoids (see |FRAME: PWY-6475|).

They are analogs of |FRAME: Ubiquinones "ubiquinones"| (Coenzyme Q), with two methyl groups substituting the methoxy groups found in Q. Plastoquinone can function as acceptor/donor for one or two electrons. The fully reduced form is called |FRAME: Plastoquinols|.

Plastoquinone was isolated originally in 1946 from alfalfa, but was not identified at the time. It was rediscovered in 1959 and its structure was described in the same year (see |CITS: [7022156]|).

Please note that the structure shown here is that of |FRAME: CPD-12829| and is not accurate for this generic class of compounds, which contains plastoquinols with different side-chain lengths.
PLASTOQUINONE

Plastoquinones are found in the chloroplasts of higher plants, red, brown and green algae, and in cyanobacteria, and are important members of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, where they carry electrons from |FRAME: CPLX490-3506| to the |FRAME: CPLX-9022|. In fact, it has been shown that in cyanobacteria essentially all electron transport through unbound quinones proceeds via PQ in cyanobacterial thylakoids. Apart from PQ the only quinone found in thylakoids is vitamin K1, which is associated with PS I |CITS: [Vermaas01]|.

Plastoquinones also serve as cofactors involved in the desaturation of phytoene in the synthesis of carotenoids (see |FRAME: PWY-6475|).

Porphyrins
rings joined together by four methine (=CH-) groups to form a larger macrocycle ring.
Substituted porphines are called porphyrins. Many porphyrins occur in nature, and fulfil important
biochemical roles. 
Porphyrins can bind metals to form complexes. The metal ion, usually with a charge of 2+ or 3+,
resides in the central cavity formed by the loss of two protons. Many metals are found with different
derivatives, including Fe, Mg, Ni, Co and Zn.
The name porphyrin comes from a Greek word for purple, since most porphyrins are red to purple
in color. More reduced porphyrins, such as corphins, are yellowish.

Retinals
Retinal is a polyene chromophore, and bound to proteins called opsins, is the chemical basis of animal vision. Bound to proteins called |FRAME: Bacteriorhodopsins bacteriorhodopsins|, retinal allows certain microorganisms to convert light into metabolic energy.

Carnivorous vertebrate animals obtain retinal directly from dietary meat. Vegetarian animals produce retinal from one of four carotenoids: |FRAME: CPD1F-129|, |FRAME: CPD1F-118|, |FRAME: CPD1F-126|, and |FRAME: CPD-7409|, which they must obtain from plants or other photosynthetic organisms.

Invertebrates such as insects and squid use hydroxylated forms of retinal in their visual systems, which they derive from  from other xanthophylls.
Retinoates

There are three stereoisomeric forms of retinoic acid: |FRAME: RETINOATE|, |FRAME: CPD-13549|, and |FRAME: CPD-13548|, which show different binding affinities to the retinoic acid receptors. 

|FRAME: RETINOATE| is known to bind exclusively to  the nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), whereas |FRAME: CPD-13549| binds to both RARs and  retinoid x-receptors (RXRs). |FRAME: CPD-13548| is naturally generated in the body, yet it has a 100-fold lower affinity to RARs than |FRAME: RETINOATE| or |FRAME: CPD-13549|, and it does not bind to RXRs.

Deffciency causes severe neurological disorders characterized by hyperphenylalaninaemia and monoamine neurotransmitter deffciency, and is also implicated in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and depression (|CITS: [11592814][10727395]|.

|FRAME: TETRA-H-BIOPTERIN Tetrahydrobiopterin| is present in probably every cell or tissue of higher animals |CITS: [10727395]|. On the other hand, most bacteria, fungi and plants do not synthesize tetrahydrobiopterin.
However, tetrahydrobiopterin was found in glycosylated forms in some groups of bacteria including cyanobacteria |CITS: [11113566]| and the anaerobic photosynthetic <i>Chlorobium</i> species |CITS: [9468332]|, and have been reported in several types of fungi |CITS: [7899493][21852350]|.

It is one of only two unsaturated fatty acids in |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [6988423]| (see |FRAME: PWY-5973|). Some plant species such as |FRAME: TAX-48545| and |FRAME: TAX-73871| (<i>Doxantha unguis-cati</i> L.) produce relatively high levels of |FRAME: CPD-9245| and |FRAME: CPD-9247| in their seed oils |CITS: [CHISHOLMMJ60][CHISHOLMMJ65]|.

[4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters feature four iron ions and four sulfide ions placed at the vertices of a cubane-type structure.  The Fe centers are typically further coordinated by cysteinyl ligands. 

Two main types of [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters are low-potential (bacterial-type) clusters and high-potential (HiPIP) clusters. The bacterial clusters shift between the oxidation states +1 and +2, while the HiPIP clusters shift between the oxidation states +2 and +3.

In some enzymes the [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters bind substrates and are thus classified as enzyme cofactors. For example, in radical SAM enzymes the cluster binds and reduces S-adenosylmethionine, generating a radical that interacts with the enzyme's substrate.

Like other NSAID drugs (e.g. |FRAME: CPD-524| and |FRAME: Ibuprofen|), acetaminophen works by inhibiting the enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.14.99.1| (also known as cyclooxygenase or COX) that converts |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| to |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2|, a precursor to other prostaglandins that mediate pain, inflammation, and fever. In addition, |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2| is also a precursor of |FRAME: ALPHA11-ALPHA-EPOXY-15-HYDROXYTHROMBA|, which stimulates platelet aggregation. The inhibition of the COX1 variant of the COX cyclooxygenase also reduces the formation of blood clots.

The mechanism of action of acetaminophen is not completely understood. However, it has been shown to be highly selective for the |FRAME: HS01115| (COX2) variant and has only minimal activity on the |FRAME: HS01815| (COX1) variant. Because of its selectivity for COX2 it does not significantly inhibit the production of the pro-clotting thromboxanes.

Acetaminophen was developed as a replacement for |FRAME: N-ACETYLARYLAMINE|, an |FRAME: ANILINE| derivative that was serendipitously found in 1886 to possess analgesic and antipyretic properties, but had severe toxic effects. Acetaminophen was tried on patients as early as 1887, but was considered inferior to |FRAME: CPD-15515| due to a report that it causes methemoglobinemia. In 1948 it was shown that |FRAME: CPD-15515| is actually metabolized to acetominophen, and that methemoglobinemia was caused by a different metabolite, |FRAME: HYDROXYAMINOBENZENE|. Following these discoveries acetaminophen's use became widespread. It was first marketed in the United States in 1953.  The best known brand today, Tylenol, was established in 1955 and was named by contraction of para-ace<b>tyl</b>aminoph<b>enol</b>. By the 1980s |FRAME: CPD-7669| sales exceeded those of |FRAME: CPD-524| in many countries.

In addition, the cofactor also participates at a later stage of all methanogenesis pathways. These pathways converge at the compound |FRAME:Me-CoM|, which is then disproportionated into |FRAME: CH4| and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|; the latter process involves methanofuran (see |FRAME: PWY-5209|).

Methanofuran is also used by methylotrophic bacteria as a coenzyme to oxidize formaldehyde to formate |CITS: [9651254][11532013]|.

Methanofurans are the only cofactors known to contain a furan moiety, although furans have been identified in polyketides and fatty acid derived natural products, and are often formed during the heating or oxidation of carbohydrates |CITS: [12013276]|.

RETINAL
Retinal is a polyene chromophore, and bound to proteins called opsins, is the chemical basis of animal vision. Bound to proteins called type 1 rhodopsins, retinal allows certain microorganisms to convert light into metabolic energy.

Carnivorous vertebrate animals obtain retinal directly from dietary meat. Vegetarian animals produce retinal from one of four carotenoids: |FRAME: CPD1F-129|, |FRAME: CPD1F-118|, |FRAME: CPD1F-126|, and |FRAME: CPD-7409|, which they must obtain from plants or other photosynthetic organisms.

Invertebrates such as insects and squid use hydroxylated forms of retinal in their visual systems, which they derive from  from other xanthophylls.
RETINOATE
During early embryonic development, retinoic acid generated in a specific region of the embryo helps determine position along the embryonic anterior/posterior axis by serving as an intercellular signaling molecule that guides development of the posterior portion of the embryo |CITS: [18805086]|. It acts through Hox genes, which ultimately control anterior/posterior patterning in early developmental stages |CITS: [17495912]|.

In the adult, retinoate is responsible for most of the activity of vitamin A, save visual pigment effects which require |FRAME: RETINAL|, and cell metabolism effects that may require |FRAME: CPD-13524|.

Retinoate is produced from |FRAME: CPD-13524| in two sequential oxidation steps, via |FRAME: RETINAL|. Once produced, it cannot be reduced again to retinol.
CPD-13524

|FRAME: RETINAL Retinal|, the aldehyde form of vitamin A, is essential for vision, and |FRAME: RETINOATE|, the acid form, is essential for skin health and bone growth.

Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering.

Additional information on the nomenclature of <i>myo</i>-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document <A href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf">Nomenclature of cyclitols</A> by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication <A href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html">Numbering of atoms in <i>myo</i>-inositol</A>, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication.

To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathways (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.64"|).

TREHALOSE

In fact, |FRAME: TREHALOSE| is a disaccharide that is ubiquitous in the biosphere. It consists of two subunits of glucose bound by their reducing ends in an &alpha;:1-1 linkage (&alpha;-D-glucopyranosil &alpha;-D-glucopyranoside) and thus does not have a reducing end. Trehalose has been isolated and characterized from many prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, insects and mammals |CITS: [11081789]|.

In addition to being nonreducing, trehalose possesses several unique properties, including high hydrophilicity, chemical stability, nonhygroscopic glass formation and no internal hydrogen bond formation. The combination of these features explains the principal role of trehalose as a stress metabolite.

In prokaryotic organisms trehalose can be used as external carbon source |CITS: [7651129]|, a compatible solute (in cyanobacteria and photosynthetic bacteria) |CITS: [8480996]|, a stress protector |CITS: [8391102]|, and a structural component (part of the cord factor in mycobacteria) |CITS: [8075141]|. In yeast and filamentous fungi, the main roles of trehalose are as a carbohydrate storage |CITS: [6325857]| and as a stress protector |CITS: [7887593]|. The enzymes for trehalose metabolism are present in higher animals, but their precise role is not well understood |CITS: [11081789]|.

Anthraquinones

In fungi and some higher plants (Leguminosae, Rhamnaceae, Polygonaceae, and Caesalpiniaceae), anthraquinones are biosynthesized via a polyketide pathway which comprises the successive condensation of acetyl CoA with 7 molecules of malonyl CoA to form an octa-&alpha;-keto-acyl chain, which is converted to the anthraquinone system via decarboxylation, cyclization, and aromatization.

The length of dolichol molecules varies within a range in a species, and the range varies among species (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|). In mammals dolichols are usually within the range of 80 to 105 carbons. Archaebacteria prefer dolichols of 55-60 carbons.

The main function of dolychols is to act as a membrane anchor for the formation of oligosaccharides, which are then transferred to certain asparagine residues within proteins through a modification process known as |FRAME: MANNOSYL-CHITO-DOLICHOL-BIOSYNTHESIS "N-glycosylation"|.

The structure shown here is of a C55 dolichol, containing 11 isoprene units, unsaturated at both the &alpha; and &omega; isoprene units, which is typical to some archaea.

Inositols

Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering.

Additional information on the nomenclature of <i>myo</i>-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document <A href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf">Nomenclature of cyclitols</A> by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication <A href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html">Numbering of atoms in <i>myo</i>-inositol</A>, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication.

To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathways (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.64"|).

FeS-Centers

Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues that are coordinated with the iron atoms in regular |FRAME: CPD-6| are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.

Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 

In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur clusters are also known to participate in
the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes
and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|.

Studies of the biosynthesis of |FRAME: ASPARAGUSATE| showed that it is derived from |FRAME: ISOBUTYRATE| via |FRAME: CPD-13859|, and that cysteine can act as the donor for at least one of the sulfur atoms, but the exact pathway is still not known |CITS: [Parry83][Parry85]|.

In 1897, chemists working at Bayer AG produced a synthetically altered version of |FRAME: CPD-1142|, derived from the species |FRAME: TAX-57917| (meadowsweet), which caused less digestive upset than pure |FRAME: CPD-110|. The new drug, acetylsalicylate, was named Aspirin, which is derived from "acetyl" and "Spirsaure", an old German name for salicylate derived from the genus name |FRAME: TAX-23224|.

|FRAME: CPD-524 Aspirin| is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for pain relief, fever reduction, and against swelling. Like other NSAID drugs (e.g. |FRAME: CPD-7669| and |FRAME: Ibuprofen|), aspirin works by inhibiting the enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.14.99.1| (also known as cyclooxygenase or COX) that converts |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| to |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2|, a precursor to other prostaglandins that mediate pain, inflammation, and fever. In addition, |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2| is also a precursor of |FRAME: ALPHA11-ALPHA-EPOXY-15-HYDROXYTHROMBA|, which stimulates platelet aggregation. The inhibition of the COX1 variant of the COX cyclooxygenase also reduces the formation of blood clots.

Aspirin acts by acetylating a serine residue in the active site of  the COX cyclooxygenase. Aspirin is much more active on the |FRAME: HS01815| (COX1) variant than on the |FRAME: HS01115| (COX2) variant.

The popularity of aspirin grew over the first half of the 20th century, largely due to its effectiveness during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, but declined after |FRAME: CPD-7669| was released in 1956, followed by |FRAME: Ibuprofen| in 1969.

Following the discovery of aspirin's efficacy as an anticlotting agent, sales revived and remain strong due to its widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks and strokes.

BIOTIN

Biotin was first discovered at the turn of the 20th century as a yeast growth factor, and was named bios |CITS: [Wildiers01]|. 30 years later, the compound was purified from egg yolk by Koegl and Toennis |CITS: [Koegl36]|. In a completely unrelated research, Gyoergy and his colleagues discovered biotin in liver in 1931, and isolated it in 1941. They named it vitamin H (for the German word for skin: Haut) |CITS: [Vigneaud41]|. At the same time, another group, which was working on <i>Rhizobia</i> bacteria, also identified it as an essential cofactor, which they named coenzyme R |CITS: [Allison38]|.

Already in 1933, Gyoergy suggested that coenzyme R, bios and vitamin H were all the same molecule. The structure of biotin was solved in 1941 -1942 |CITS: [Vigneaud41B][Melville42]|. In 1949 the first evidence was published demonstrating the biochemical role of biotin in carboxylation reactions, |CITS: [Lardy49]|, and in 1958 it was suggested that biotin was probably associated with an enzyme |CITS: [13560478]|. Shortly after this finding, Lynen et al |CITS: [Lynen61]| described biotin's biological function as a cofactor in the biotin-dependent carboxylases.

BILIRUBIN-BISGLUCURONOSIDE

The structure of bilirubin-IX &alpha; was originally established by Hans Fischer in 1941, who did not specify the isomeric configuration |CITS: [Fischer41]|. It was later shown that the naturally occurring form of bilirubin is the |FRAME: BILIRUBIN "<i>Z,Z</i> isomer"| |CITS: [Lemberg49]|. However, when exposed to light, the Z,Z isomer converts to an |FRAME: CPD-20930 <i>E,E</i> isomer"|.

Unconjugated bilirubin is extremely water insoluble. It is carried (mostly by albumin) to the liver, where it is converted to glucuronides, which are water soluble. The glucuronides are eventually excreted in bile. Glucuronated forms include both monoglucuronides (a mixture of the two positional isomers |FRAME: CPD-20932| and |FRAME: BILIRUBIN-GLUCURONOSIDE|) and |FRAME: BILIRUBIN-BISGLUCURONOSIDE| |CITS: [5145912][949313][7378044]|.

Four basic forms of bilirubin are found in blood: |FRAME: BILIRUBIN "unconjugated bilirubin"| (&alpha; bilirubin), |FRAME: BILIRUBIN-GLUCURONOSIDE "mono-conjugated"| (&beta; bilirubin), |FRAME: BILIRUBIN-BISGLUCURONOSIDE "di-conjugated"| (&gamma; bilirubin), and protein bound (&delta; bilirubin) |CITS: [5902889]|.

Opium alkaloids, including morphine, are known to act as chemical defense compounds to protect opium poppy against various herbivores.

In response to stress, the capsules of opium poppies immediately metabolize morphine to dimeric morphine species, called bismorphine A and |FRAME: CPD-12316|.

Teleocidin is a natural substance originally isolated from mycelia of the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-58352|. It was found to be a mixture of two teleocidin A isomers (named |FRAME: CPD-18328 "teleocidin A-1"| and |FRAME: CPD-18330|) and four teleocidin B isomers (|FRAME: CPD-18329|, |FRAME: CPD-18337|, |FRAME: CPD-18338|, and |FRAME: CPD-18339|) |CITS: [Takashima60][Fujiki83][2890278]|. Teleocidins are highly inflammatory due to their strong activation of protein kinase C, and each purified isomer of teleocidins A and B has approximately the same activity as the teleocidin mixture in an irritant test. They also promote tumor formation |CITS: [3134123]|.

Teleocidin A-1 was later isolated from a Hawaiian shallow-water variety of the cyanobactrium |FRAME: TAX-1155739| (originally misclassified as |FRAME: TAX-158786| |CITS: [21724952]|), and named |FRAME: CPD-18328| |CITS: [107586]|. |FRAME: TAX-1155739| produces several related compounds including |FRAME: CPD-18331| and |FRAME: CPD-18332| |CITS: [2128518]|.

The butirosins are unique among naturally occurring aminoglycosides since they contain an (<i>S</i>)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyrate (AHBA) side-chain at the C-1 amine of the central 2-deoxystreptamine ring. This modification has been shown to confer resistance against several aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (the C-1 amine is a frequent target of aminoglycoside N-acyltransferases). As a result, the butirosins are active toward many aminoglycoside-resistant strains.

Although the butirosins are not themselves clinically useful drugs, the properties of their side-chain have led to successful synthetic alteration of |FRAME: CPD-4822| and |FRAME: CPD-14161| to produce |FRAME: CPD-14197| and |FRAME: CPD-14162|, respectively |CITS: [62814][Watanabe87a]|.

The length of dolichol molecules varies within a range in a species, and the range varies among species (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|). In mammals dolichols are usually within the range of 80 to 105 carbons. Archaea prefer dolichols of 55-60 carbons.

The main function of dolychols is to act as a membrane anchor for the formation of oligosaccharides, which are then transferred to certain asparagine residues within proteins through a modification process known as |FRAME: MANNOSYL-CHITO-DOLICHOL-BIOSYNTHESIS "N-glycosylation"|. In eukaryotes dolichol is also involved in the transfer of some of the monosaccharides to the forming oligosaccharide.

BILIRUBIN-GLUCURONOSIDE

The structure of bilirubin-IX &alpha; was originally established by Hans Fischer in 1941, who did not specify the isomeric configuration |CITS: [Fischer41]|. It was later shown that the naturally occurring form of bilirubin is the |FRAME: BILIRUBIN "<i>Z,Z</i> isomer"| |CITS: [Lemberg49]|. However, when exposed to light, the Z,Z isomer converts to an |FRAME: CPD-20930 <i>E,E</i> isomer"|.

Unconjugated bilirubin is extremely water insoluble. It is carried (mostly by albumin) to the liver, where it is converted to glucuronides, which are water soluble. The glucuronides are eventually excreted in bile. Glucuronated forms include both monoglucuronides (a mixture of the two positional isomers |FRAME: CPD-20932| and |FRAME: BILIRUBIN-GLUCURONOSIDE|) and |FRAME: BILIRUBIN-BISGLUCURONOSIDE| |CITS: [5145912][949313][7378044]|.

However, when exposed to light, the Z,Z isomer converts to an |FRAME: CPD-20930 <i>E,E</i> isomer"|.

Unconjugated bilirubin is extremely water insoluble. It is carried (mostly by albumin) to the liver, where it is converted to glucuronides, which are water soluble.

The length of dolichol molecules varies within a range in a species, and the range varies among species (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|). In mammals dolichols are usually within the range of 80 to 105 carbons. Archaebacteria prefer dolichols of 55-60 carbons.

|FRAME: DOLICHOLP "Dolichyl phosphate"| acts as a membrane-bound carrier in the assembly of pyrophosphate-linked oligosaccharides. It can accept the respective sugar residues from the donors |FRAME: UDP-N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE|, |FRAME: CPD-12575| and |FRAME: GDP-MANNOSE|. When the complete oligosaccharide is transferred to a protein L-asparagine residue, |FRAME: Dolichol-PP| is produced. It can be converted back to |FRAME: DOLICHOLP| by |FRAME: EC-3.6.1.43|..

The main active ingredient (about 0.7%) of the bile is bile acids.

Bile acids are classified into primary and secondary. The primary bile acids are produced in the liver from |FRAME: CHOLESTEROL|. About half of the cholesterol produced in the body is used for bile acid synthesis. Their structures vary, as do their proportions in different species. The primary bile acids are conjugated in the liver with |FRAME: GLY| or |FRAME: TAURINE| before secretion into the bile. Further conversion into secondary bile acids occurs through the action of microbial enzymes in the gut.

The primary bile acids |FRAME: CHOLATE| and |FRAME: CPD-15189| are synthesized from |FRAME: CHOLESTEROL| by a series of oxidative transformations in the liver. They are further modified by attachemnt of a glycine or taurine molecule, forming |FRAME: GLYCOCHOLIC_ACID|, |FRAME: GLYCOCHENODEOXYCHOLIC_ACID|, |FRAME: CPD-3743|, and |FRAME: CPD-7283| (see |FRAME: PWY-6061|).

Following a meal, the bile acids are secreted into the small intestine, where they play an important role in digestion by acting as detergents. The majority (~97%) of the bile acids are reabsorbed in the ileum and return to the liver. The rest enter the large intestine, where they are modified by bacteria into secondary bile acids. The principal actions of gut bacteria on bile acids are C24-amide hydrolysis (releasing the glycine and taurine molecules) and 7&alpha;-dehydroxylation, forming |FRAME: DEOXYCHOLATE| and |FRAME: CPD-7235| |CITS: [26192599]|.

Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering.

Additional information on the nomenclature of <i>myo</i>-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document <A href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf">Nomenclature of cyclitols</A> by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication <A href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html">Numbering of atoms in <i>myo</i>-inositol</A>, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication.

To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathways (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.64"|).

All three antibiotics contain a 7-hydroxy-2-aminocoumarin core. The phenolic 7-hydroxyl group of the bicyclic aminocoumarin scaffold is attached to an L-noviosyl sugar moiety, while the 2-amino group is ligated to a prenylated
hydroxybenzoate unit (in |FRAME: CPD-15417| and |FRAME: CPD-15421|) or to a methylpyrroledicarboxylic acid that links two aminocoumarin moieties (in |FRAME: CPD-15504|). The noviosyl sugar is then methylated at the 4'-OH position and acylated at the 3'-OH position to produce the mature, active antibiotic.

The pharmacophore of these antibiotics is the decorated noviosyl sugar, which is presented by the planar aminocoumarin to the ATP binding site of the GyrB subunit of gyrase to interdict DNA replication |CITS: [8635474][9144789]|.

Biologically active forms of cobamides contain an upper (&beta;) and a lower (&alpha;) axial ligands. The most common upper axial ligand are either a methyl group or a 5'-deoxyadenosyl group, although some other forms exist. More variability is found with the lower axial ligand, where more that 16 different forms have been described. This class includes all cobamides that have an adenine base as their upper axial ligand.

Cobamides that have an adenine molecule as the lower ligand are known as pseudocobalamins. They are known to be produced by different bacterial genera |CITS: [10552882][10940017][17888910][24055007][27040778][27737643]|.

bacteria. It was initially observed in 1977 by Jean LeGall in extracts of |FRAME: TAX-145262|. The name factor 430 (F430) was coined by Gunsalus and Wolfe who reported the absorbance maximumat 430 nm |CITS: [Gunsalus78]|. The compound belongs to the corphins, a class of compounds that combine structural elements of both |FRAME: Corrins corrins| and |FRAME: Porphyrins porphyrins| |CITS: [Eschenmoser86]|.

In 1982 Ellefson et al showed that |FRAME:CPD-19766| is a cofactor of the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.8.4.1| (methyl-coenzyme M reductase) |CITS: [6954513]|. This enzyme catalyzes the final step of methane production in all methanogenic bacteria: the reduction of the methyl group in |FRAME: Me-CoM| to |FRAME:CH4|.

F430 exists in two distinct intracellular pools: either bound to methyl-CoM reductase or free of protein in the cytosol. Early literature on F430 was confusing due to reports of heterogeneity in F430 samples that depended on the isolation and purification procedures used in different laboratories. Later work showed that F430 exists primarily in two isomeric forms. These forms differ in the relative stereochemical disposition of acid side chains at positions 12 and 13 |CITS: [3356701]|.

The biosynthetic route leading to |FRAME: PWY-5196| was discovered only in 2016 |CITS: [27846569]|.

In addition to its role in methanogenesis, |FRAME:CoM| is used by some bacteria for the utilization of aliphtic alkenes, serving during ring opening of toxic epoxide intermediates |CITS: [10411892]|.

All three antibiotics contain a 7-hydroxy-2-aminocoumarin core. The phenolic 7-hydroxyl group of the bicyclic aminocoumarin scaffold is attached to an L-noviosyl sugar moiety, while the 2-amino group is ligated to a prenylated
hydroxybenzoate unit (in |FRAME: CPD-15417| and |FRAME: CPD-15421|) or to a methylpyrroledicarboxylic acid that links two aminocoumarin moieties (in |FRAME: CPD-15504|). The noviosyl sugar is then methylated at the 4'-OH position and acylated at the 3'-OH position to produce the mature, active antibiotic.

The pharmacophore of these antibiotics is the decorated noviosyl sugar, which is presented by the planar aminocoumarin to the ATP binding site of the GyrB subunit of gyrase to interdict DNA replication |CITS: [8635474][9144789]|.

Other forms of cobalamin include |FRAME: CPD0-1256| (or its conjugated acid |FRAME: AQUACOBIIIALAMIN|) and |FRAME: CPD-315|. |FRAME: CPD0-1256 Hydroxocobalamin| is a naturally produced form synthesized by many bacterial species, while |FRAME: CPD-315| is a common semi-synthetic form produced from bacterially-synthesized |FRAME: CPD0-1256|. Vitamin B12 pills often contain |FRAME: CPD-315|, which is converted to the active forms in the body.

The cobalt ion embedded in cobalamin may exist in different charges (+1, +2 or +3), and the different forms of the compound are referred to as |FRAME: COB-I-ALAMIN|, |FRAME: CPD-1829| and |FRAME: CPD-17105|, respectively.

Cyanocob(III)alamin is a |FRAME: CPD-17105| derivative where the |FRAME: CO+3| ion is held in place partly due to an upper cyano group. The cyano group is an artificial ligand, created as a result of the extraction procedure. It is converted in mammals to active forms of cobalamin by the action of |FRAME: EC-1.16.1.6|.

C-DI-GMP

The most intensively studied process that c-di-GMP participated in is the transition between motile and sessile lifestyles in Gram-negative bacteria. Changes in the levels of this signaling molecule are associated with phenotypic modifications related to virulence, motility, production of exopolysaccharides, colony morphology, and expression of functions involved in biofilm development. High intracellular levels of c-di-GMP favor the settlement of bacteria in the form of sessile populations (surface-attached cells and biofilms), whilst low levels of this molecule promote motility and a planktonic lifestyle |CITS: [19287449][28163311]|.

It imparts a buttery aroma and flavour, and has an important stylistic role in wine. In beer, diacetyl is considered
a spoilage factor. During beer maturation, 2-acetolactate is slowly converted to diacetyl by a chemical,
non-enzymatic process, and the diacetyl is converted to acetoin by diacetyl reductase of the yeast cells. for this
purpose, purified enzyme is sometimes added to the wort |CITS: [2198252]|.

In marine, estuarine, and salt marsh systems, the main source of DMS is the degradation of |FRAME: SS-DIMETHYL-BETA-PROPIOTHETIN| (DMSP), an osmolyte of many marine algae and certain plants |CITS: [15181109]|. DMSP is readily degraded in a variety of biological systems, including bacterial cultures, salt marsh sediments, and seawater samples containing algae and zooplankton |CITS: [16347732]|. There are two main routes for DMSP degradation, leading to formation of either |FRAME: CPD-7670| or |FRAME: CPD-7672|. Other sources for DMS include the reduction of |FRAME: DMSO|, the methylation of |FRAME: CPD-7671|, and the degradation of sulfur-containing amino acids.

DMS, which is very volatile, is exchanged freely between the ocean and the atmosphere, and is considered the main natural source of sulfur to the atmosphere. Once in the troposphere, DMS is oxidized to |FRAME: SULFATE| and |FRAME: CPD-3746|, which attract water and promote cloud formation and thus influence the climate |CITS: [Charlson87]|. However, up to 90% of the DMS in the ocean is degraded biologically |CITS: [Kiene90]|.

DMS is toxic, and attempts to isolate in pure culture DMS-degrading organisms that can use it as the sole carbon and energy source have been often unsuccessful due to this toxicity. However, several organisms capable of degerading DMS have been isolated over the years. Aerobic bacterial DMS oxidation has been demonstrated in organisms from a few taxonomic domains, including Thiobacillus sp. strain MS1 |CITS: [Sivela80]|, |FRAME: ORG-5989| |CITS: [Kanagawa82]
[Kanagawa86][2930168][Tanji89][Gould92]|, |FRAME: ORG-6053| |CITS: [1872604][8285684]|, |FRAME: ORG-6050| |CITS: [Debont81]|, |FRAME: ORG-6052| |CITS:[3767349][Suylen86][Suylen87][Smith88a]| and |FRAME:TAX-392484| |CITS:[16535680][17322322]|.

Marine phytoplankton synthesize DMSP not only as an osmolyte, but also as a predator deterrent and an antioxidant |CITS: [17068264]|. The degradation of DMSP to DMS and subsequent exchange of DMS across the ocean-atmosphere boundary is the main natural source of sulfur to the atmosphere.

This type of luciferin is found in bioluminescent dinoflagellate.

The |FRAME: CPD-13067 Luciferin| from |FRAME: TAX-2972| has been fully characterized, and shown to be a linear tetrapyrrole with similarity to |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLLIDE-A| |CITS: [Nakamura89]|. The molecule exhibits a characteristic blue fluorescence (475 nm) when irradiated with UV light. A study with amino acid tracers has confirmed the intracellular production of the compound in |FRAME: TAX-2972| |CITS: [Wu03]|. It has been suggested that the luciferin is a product of chlorophyll degradation by means of photooxidation |CITS: [11668566]|, but there are some indications that may not be the case: luciferin only appears in |FRAME: TAX-160621| at the onset of the dark-phase, at which time no sun light is available for photooxidation |CITS: [14766208]|. In addition, bioluminescence persisted in the heterotrophic dinoflagellate |FRAME: TAX-281609| after being cultured for one year on rice flour, at which point no chlorophyl was produced |CITS: [27041627]|.

|FRAME: CPD-13067 Luciferin| has been fully characterized from |FRAME: TAX-2972|, and shown to be a linear tetrapyrrole with similarity to |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLLIDE-A| |CITS: [Nakamura89]|. The molecule exhibits a characteristic blue fluorescence (475 nm) when irradiated with UV light. A study with amino acid tracers has confirmed the intracellular production of luciferin in |FRAME: TAX-2972| |CITS: [Wu03]|. It has been suggested that luciferin is a product of chlorophyll degradation by means of photooxidation |CITS: [11668566]|, but there are some indications that may not be the case: luciferin only appears in |FRAME: TAX-160621| at the onset of the dark-phase, at which time no sun light is available for photooxidation |CITS: [14766208]|. In addition, bioluminescence persisted in the heterotrophic dinoflagellate |FRAME: TAX-281609| after being cultured for one year on rice flour, at which point no chlorophyl was produced |CITS: [27041627]|..

DPA has been widely used as a precursor of dyes, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and photographic chemicals and as a stabilizer for explosives |CITS: [14505701]|. It is a common contaminant at munitions-contaminated sites and |FRAME: ANILINE| manufacturing sites, and is potentially hazardous to aquatic organisms |CITS: [8521780]|.

Bacteria able to use DPA as the growth substrate have been reported |CITS:[7066552][9353218][14505701]|, and a complete degradation pathway has been proposed |CITS: [19251893]|.

A Gram-negative, non-sporeforming strictly anaerobic marine bacterium could utilize it as sole source of carbon, energy, and nitrogen, and fermented it to acetate, propionate, ammonia, and 2 molecules of CO<sub>2</sub> |CITS: [1368138]|.

 Another study has shown that the compound can be transformed by aerobic marine bacteria to |FRAME: CPD-22553|, which was then photolyzed with a half-life of 100 minutes. The details of this degradation process are not known |CITS: [16348188]|.

DIPYRROMETHANE

The dipyrromethane cofactor is not found as a free compound. It arises from |FRAME: HYDROXYMETHYLBILANE| in a process that starts with the C-alkylation of an internal L-cysteine residue (Cys-261 in |FRAME: TAX-562|) of the <i>apo</i>-deaminase by reaction with the 1-hydroxymethyl group of |FRAME: HYDROXYMETHYLBILANE|. This alkylation does not generate the cofator but the |FRAME: Hydroxymethylbilane-Synthase-ES2 ES<sub>2</sub>| intermediate. Thus the cofactor is generated only after the enzyme has added two more pyrrole units to form the hexapyrrole, followed by release of |FRAME: HYDROXYMETHYLBILANE| |CITS: [8687374]|.

Emodin is a plant defense compound and has a deterrent effect on a large spectrum of organisms from invertebrates to vertebrates |CITS: [Trial79]|.  

Emodin and its derivatives has been widely used from ancient times as laxatives. When ingested by mammals, emodin glycosides, which are the most common form in plants, are carried unabsorbed to the large intestine, where they are metabolized to the active aglycones by intestinal bacterial flora. The aglycone exerts its laxative effect by damaging epithelial cells, which leads directly and indirectly to changes in absorption, secretion and motility. Emodin also inhibits the ion transport (Cl--channels) across colon cells, contributing to the laxative effect |CITS: [10456676]|.

Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering.

Additional information on the nomenclature of <i>myo</i>-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document <A href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf">Nomenclature of cyclitols</A> by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication <A href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html">Numbering of atoms in <i>myo</i>-inositol</A>, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication.

To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathways (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.64"|).

The most significant difference between EGT and other biological thiols is the instability of the EGT disulfide under physiological conditions. Unlike other small thiols such as |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE|, EGT is stable in its reduced form in aerated aqueous solutions and does not form the disulfide |CITS: [15730267]|. Another significant difference is that EGT exists predominantly as the |FRAME: Ergothioneine-Thione "thione form"| at physiological pH |CITS: [22001064]|.

Although EGT is not synthesized by non-fungal eukaryotes, animals and plants acquire EGT from the environment through a specific transporter, ETT/OCTN1 |CITS: [15795384]|. It has been shown that the human body absorbs it from dietary sources and concentrates it in specific tissues or cells such as liver, kidney, central nervous system, and red blood cells |CITS: [2172707]|.

Erythromycin A is used in clinical medicine against infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. It is also used for many pulmonary infections such as Legionnaires disease and as an alternative for patients allergic to penicillins |CITS: [11851474]|.

Erythromycin contains a 14-membered lactone ring with ten asymmetric centers (the aglycone is called |FRAME: CPD-13947|) and two sugars (|FRAME: CPD-13969| and |FRAME: CPD-13780|). The structure was elucidated in 1957 |CITS: [Wiley57]|, and the absolute stereochemistry was assigned by X-ray crystallography in 1965 |CITS: [14295195]|.

Erythromycin binds to the 50s subunit of the bacterial 70s rRNA complex, inhibiting protein synthesis, and thus stopping structural and functional processes that are critical for life or replication. More specifically, erythromycin interferes with aminoacyl translocation, preventing the transfer of the tRNA bound at the A site of the rRNA complex to the P site of the rRNA complex.

|FRAME: CPD-19988 Ethionamide| is a prodrug, and requires metabolism by a bacterial enzyme before having a bactericidal effect. It is activated <i>in situ</i> by the enzymes ethA and MymA, two a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases of |FRAME: TAX-1773| |CITS: [27321573]|. The final product of several rounds of oxygenation binds NAD+ to form an adduct that inhibits the |FRAME: CPLX-8831| (encoded by the |FRAME: G185E-5668| gene), similar to the action of |FRAME: ISONIAZIDE| |CITS: [8284673][9417034][10508348]|.

InhA is a component of the FAS II system of |FRAME: TAX-1773|, catalyzing the enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase step in the elongation cycle. The enzyme acts on very long and unsaturated fatty acids during the elongation phase, before they are modified and incorporated into mycolic acids. Disruption of the enzyme results in disruption in mycolic acid biosynthesis |CITS: [1416831]|.

The immediate product of the heme biosynthesis pathways (by ferro-chelation of |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX|) is |FRAME: Heme-b "heme <i>b</i>"|, whose |FRAME: PROTOHEME "ferrous form"| is known as protoheme IX. |FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| differs from heme <i>b</i> in that a methyl side chain at ring position 8 is oxidized to a formyl group, and a hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain is attached to the vinyl side chain at ring position 2. It is synthesized from |FRAME: Heme-b| via |FRAME: HEME_O|, which lacks the formyl group but contains the hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain, and a short-lived |FRAME: Heme_I| intermediate |CITS: [7885224]|.

The term "|FRAME: HEME_C|" has been used to describe the heme group attached to |FRAME: Cytochromes-c "<i>c</i>-type cytochromes"|.

The extreme toxicity of |FRAME: CPD-12709| stems from its similarity to acetate. Fluoroacetate combines with coenzyme A to form |FRAME: CPD-12716|, which can substitute for acetyl CoA in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. |FRAME: CPD-12716 Fluoroacetyl-CoA| reacts with citrate synthase to produce |FRAME: FLUORO-CITRATE|, a metabolite of which then binds very tightly to aconitase, halting the cycle.
Sodium fluoroacetate was introduced as a rodenticide in the US in 1946, but its extreme toxicity limits its uses. Currently, it is licensed in the US for use against coyotes, which prey on sheep and goats, and in Australia and New Zealand to kill unwanted introduced species |CITS: [17288493]|.

Glactitol also occurs in the cataractous lenses of galactosemic animals as a metabolic product of galactose, causing a hypertonic condition whereby water is drawn into the lens fibres, which become opaque and may eventually rupture |CITS: [14032902][4691951][26550203]|.

Galanthamin is used for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and various other memory impairments. Galanthamine hydrobromide, under the generic name Reminyl, is the first amaryllidaceae alkaloid to be approved as a prescription drug by the FDA due to its high inhibitory efficacy and both reversible and selective activity on acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme serves a major function in transmissions of nerve pulse by hydrolysis of acetylcholine.

Galanthamine displays IC50 value of 1.5 &mu;M, exceeding other alkaloids in inhibitory potency by over 20 folds. |FRAME: CPD-19442 Sanguinine|, a 9-hydroxy analog, is even more active, being about 10 fold more active than galanthamine |CITS: [He15]|.

Following a meal, the bile acids are secreted into the small intestine, where they play an important role in digestion by acting as detergents. The majority (~97%) of the bile acids are reabsorbed in the ileum and return to the liver. The rest enter the large intestine, where they are modified by bacteria into secondary bile acids. The principal actions of gut bacteria on bile acids are C24-amide hydrolysis (releasing the glycine and taurine molecules) and 7&alpha;-dehydroxylation, forming |FRAME: DEOXYCHOLATE| and |FRAME: CPD-7235| |CITS: [26192599]|.
GLYCOCHENODEOXYCHOLATE-7-SULFATE
GLYCOCHOLIC_ACID
The main active ingredient (about 0.7%) of the bile is bile acids.

Bile acids are classified into primary and secondary. The primary bile acids are produced in the liver from |FRAME: CHOLESTEROL|. About half of the cholesterol produced in the body is used for bile acid synthesis. Their structures vary, as do their proportions in different species. The primary bile acids are conjugated in the liver with |FRAME: GLY| or |FRAME: TAURINE| before secretion into the bile. Further conversion into secondary bile acids occurs through the action of microbial enzymes in the gut.

The primary bile acids |FRAME: CHOLATE| and |FRAME: CPD-15189| are synthesized from |FRAME: CHOLESTEROL| by a series of oxidative transformations in the liver. They are further modified by attachemnt of a glycine or taurine molecule, forming |FRAME: GLYCOCHOLIC_ACID|, |FRAME: GLYCOCHENODEOXYCHOLIC_ACID|, |FRAME: CPD-3743|, and |FRAME: CPD-7283| (see |FRAME: PWY-6061|).

Alas, later research was not able to reproduce the finding. After the original supplies of the compound were used up, repeated attempts over 4 years to re-isolate harderoporphyrin, by three groups of workers, including the original provider, were unsuccessful |CITS: [Jackson76]|.

A careful analysis performed in 2005 concluded that all of the early results were obtained from material not originally present in the Harderian glands but arising from procedural artefacts. Thus the authors claimed that harderoporphyrin, as originally defined, has no existence |CITS: [15678522]|. Even though the exact same compound has indeed been described from faecal excretions of patients with hereditary coproporphyria |CITS: [15384152]|, the authors recommended to use the name "harderoporphyrin" to describe an unusual porphyrin that is actually present in rodent Harderian glands, namely protoporphyrin-1-<i>O</i>-acyl-&beta;-xyloside |CITS: [15678522]|.

The name has also been used for the iron-containing porphyrin |FRAME: CPD-21388|, which is an intermediate formed by |FRAME: EC-1.3.98.5| |CITS: [27936663]|.

Heme <i>a</i> was first isolated in 1951 and shown to be the active component of the integral membrane metalloprotein |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.9| |CITS: [Warburg51]|. The correct structure was published in 1975 |CITS: [170266]|.

The immediate product of the heme biosynthesis pathways (by ferro-chelation of |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX|) is |FRAME: Heme-b "heme <i>b</i>"|, whose |FRAME: PROTOHEME "ferrous form"| is known as protoheme IX. |FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| differs from heme <i>b</i> in that a methyl side chain at ring position 8 is oxidized to a formyl group, and a hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain is attached to the vinyl side chain at ring position 2. It is synthesized from |FRAME: Heme-b| via |FRAME: HEME_O|, which lacks the formyl group but contains the hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain, and a short-lived |FRAME: Heme_I| intermediate |CITS: [7885224]|.

|FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| is part of |FRAME: A-type-Cytochromes "<i>a</i>-type cytochromes"|. Like in |FRAME: Cytochromes-B "<i>b</i>-type cytochromes"|, heme <i>a</i> is often attached to the apoprotein through a coordinate bond between the heme iron and a conserved amino acid side-chain. Heme <i>a</i> is found exclusively in respiratory oxidases of mitochondria and aerobic bacteria, and all known heme <i>a</i>-containing oxidases belong to the hemecopper superfamily of terminal oxidases |CITS: [808315]|.
Heme-b

|FRAME: Heme-b "Heme <i>b</i>"|, whose |FRAME: PROTOHEME "ferrous form"| is known as protoheme IX, is the immediate product of the heme biosynthesis pathways (by ferro-chelation of |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX|) and the most abundant heme form. It is found in common proteins such as hemoglobin and myoglobin.

Heme <i>b</i> is part of |FRAME: Cytochromes-B "<i>b</i>-type cytochromes"|.
HEME_C

The term "|FRAME: HEME_C|" has been used to describe the heme group attached to |FRAME: Cytochromes-c "<i>c</i>-type cytochromes"|. Heme <i>c</i> differs from |FRAME: Heme-b| in that the two vinyl side chains of the latter are replaced by covalent, thioether linkages to the apoprotein. The two thioether linkages are typically made by cysteine residues of the protein. The covalent bonds prevent |FRAME: HEME_C| from easily dissociating from the cytochrome <i>c</i> holoprotein, unlike the case of |FRAME: Heme-b|- and |FRAME: HEME_A|-containing cytochromes.

Since the modifications that define the heme <i>c</i> molecule are generated by its attachment to the protein, it does not naturally occur in a free form. The sulfur atoms shown in this structure are not an integral part of the heme molecule, but rather show the location of the thioether bonds. This generic form does not specify the oxidation state of the iron.
HEME_D

The term "|FRAME: HEME_D|" has been used to describe the heme group found in two types of proteins: terminal oxidases such as the |FRAME: CYT-D-UBIOX-CPLX| and |FRAME: APP-UBIOX-CPLX| that predominate in |FRAME: TAX-562| at low levels of oxygen |CITS: [6307994]|, and a family of catalase enzymes, such as |FRAME: HYDROPEROXIDII-CPLX| from |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [Chiu89][18498226]|.

Initial spectroscopy data on these enzymes suggested the presence of a &gamma;-spirolactone at the saturated pyrrole ring III of the macrocycle in the C-6 position and a vicinal C-5 hydroxy group |CITS: [Sotiriu88]|, although the relative orientation of these two groups was shown to be different in the two proteins (the two substituents have the more stable <i>trans</i> configuration in the terminal oxidases, but a <i>cis</i> configuration in HPII |CITS: [Chiu89]|). The absolute stereochemistry of the two chiral centers has not been reported |CITS: [8621527]|. However, later data indicated that the actual form of |FRAME: HEME_D| is a diol, and that lactonization was an artefact |CITS: [3777943]|.

The enzymes responsible for the conversion of |FRAME: PROTOHEME| into |FRAME: HEME_D| have never been identified. It has been proposed that the formation of |FRAME: CPD-23429| may be catalyzed by HPII itself |CITS: [Timkovich90][9185614][22820098]|, though formation of |FRAME: CPD-23430| has not been explained.
Heme-d1

|FRAME: Heme-d1 "Heme <i>d</i><sub>1</sub>"| is only made by denitrifying bacteria with a cytochrome nitrite reductase <i>c</i><i>d</i><sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: G-250|) for which <i>d</i><sub>1</sub> acts as an essential cofactor, tailored to meet the mechanistic requirements of the reaction.

The structure shown here is that of the reduced form, |FRAME: CPD-17059|.
Heme_I

|FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| was first isolated in 1951 and shown to be the active component of the integral membrane metalloprotein |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.9| |CITS: [Warburg51]|. The correct structure was published in 1975 |CITS: [170266]|.

The immediate product of the initial heme biosynthesis pathways (by ferro-chelation of |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX|) is |FRAME: Heme-b "heme <i>b</i>"|, whose |FRAME: PROTOHEME "ferrous form"| is known as protoheme IX. |FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| differs from heme <i>b</i> in that a methyl side chain at position 8 of the D ring is oxidized to a formyl group, and a hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain is attached to the vinyl side chain at position 2 of the A ring. It is synthesized from |FRAME: Heme-b| via |FRAME: HEME_O| by two enzymes - |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.141|, and heme <i>a</i> synthase. It has been found that the latter acts by two successive hydroxylations, with the first hydroxylation forming a short-lived |FRAME: Heme_I| intermediate |CITS: [7885224][12206660]|.

Hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive and thus short-lived (half-life of approximately 10<sup>-9</sup> seconds). However, they form an important part of radical chemistry and are very dangerous compounds to a living organism, as they can damage virtually all types of macromolecules.

In biology, hydroxyl radicals are produced most often from the decomposition of hydroperoxides. Unlike |FRAME: SUPER-OXIDE|, the hydroxyl radical cannot be eliminated by an enzymatic reaction.

Ibuprofen
Like other NSAID drugs (e.g. |FRAME: CPD-524| and |FRAME: CPD-7669|), ibuprofen works by inhibiting the enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.14.99.1| (also known as cyclooxygenase or COX) that converts |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| to |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2|, a precursor to other prostaglandins that mediate pain, inflammation, and fever. In addition, |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2| is also a precursor of |FRAME: ALPHA11-ALPHA-EPOXY-15-HYDROXYTHROMBA|, which stimulates platelet aggregation. The inhibition of the COX1 variant of the COX cyclooxygenase also reduces the formation of blood clots.
Ibuprofen inhibits both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, |FRAME: HS01815| (COX1) and |FRAME: HS01115| (COX2).

Ibuprofen was derived from |FRAME: PROPIONATE| during the 1960s. Originally marketed as Brufen, ibuprofen is available under a variety of popular trademarks, including Motrin, Nurofen, Advil, Nuprin and many others.

The active form of ibuprofen is |FRAME: CPD-15516|. The drug is synthesized as a racemic mixture, but an isomerase encoded by the |FRAME: HS01416| gene converts the inactive |FRAME: CPD-15517 "(R)-form"| <i>in vivo</i> to the active form via a coenzyme A derivative |CITS: [9106621]|.

The biosynthesis of the FeMo cofactor is arguably one of the most complicated processes in bioinorganic chemistry.
FeMo cofactor assembly begins with the formation of |FRAME: CPD-6 "[2Fe-2S]"| and |FRAME: CPD-7 "[4Fe-4S]"| clusters, which are synthesized by the combined actions of NifS, a cysteine desulfurase, and NifU, a scaffolding protein. Both NifS and NifU are homologs of |FRAME: G7325| and |FRAME: G7324|, which have analogous roles in general FeS cluster assembly (see |FRAME: PWY-7250|).

Following the transfer of these [4Fe-4S] clusters to the |FRAME: NifB "radical SAM enzyme NifB"|, radical SAM chemistry is used to create a FeMo cofactor precursor cluster (the |FRAME: CPD-18407|) that has six to eight iron atoms, nine sulfur atoms, and one central carbon. The carbide atom originates from the methyl group of |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (SAM) |CITS: [21551100][23019640][23019652]|.

This carbon-containing precursor is transferred to a scaffold protein complex, |FRAME: NifEN NifEN|, which is structurally similar to the |FRAME: NifDK "MoFe protein"| (The NifDK component of the nitrogenase) |CITS: [17050696][16423898][21212358]|. Following insertion of molybdenum by |FRAME: holo-NifQ NifQ| |CITS: [18697927][19514721]| and attachment of |FRAME: HOMO-CIT| by |FRAME: G-44194 NifV| |CITS: [9294461][20221547]|, the cofactor is transferred to an <i>apo</i> MoFe protein (NifDK) to produce an active nitrogenase.

The cofactor is coordinated to the NifD protein by a His residue at the Mo end and a Cys residue at the opposite Fe atom, and the homocitrate entity is bound to a Lys residue |CITS: [25989647][12215645]|.

Isoprene is incorporated into cell membranes in response to heat stress, and its stabilizing effect confers some tolerance to heat spikes. Its emission increases dramatically with temperature and maximizes at around 40 &deg;C. Thus, it is thought that isoprene protects plants against heat stress |CITS: [17921528]|. It also confers some resistance to reactive oxygen species |CITS: [19183288]|.

Isoprene is a common structural motif in biological polymers, although those compounds (|FRAME: Polyisoprenoids isoprenoids|) are not derived from isoprene, but instead are synthesized from |FRAME: CPD-4211| and its isomer |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP|.

Isoprene is used to produce a diverse range of industrial products including a wide variety of specialty elastomers used in surgical gloves, motor mounts and fittings, rubber bands, golf balls, and shoes. It is also used as a component of Styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymers that form an essential part of most hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive formulations, and of <i>cis</i>-polyisoprene or synthetic rubber, which is used in tire manufacturing |CITS: [Whited10]|.

The most common amino acid in the second position is |FRAME: D-GLT|, but in some cases (in a few coryneform bacteria) it is hydroxylated to |FRAME: CPD-48| |CITS: [6072398]|. In some organisms the &alpha;-carboxyl group of |FRAME: D-GLT| is modified by amidation or substituted by |FRAME: GLY| |CITS: [5965232][6064598]|, by |FRAME: GLYCINAMIDE| |CITS: [Interschick70]|, or by |FRAME: CPD0-1578| |CITS: [4683671]|.

The greatest variation occurs at position 3. The residue at this position is usually a diamino acid and is involved in cross-linking through the second amino group. The most common residue at this position is |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|, which is present in probably all Gram-negative bacteria and in many other organisms, such as some species of bacilli, clostridia, lactobacilli, corynebacteria, propionibacteria, Actinomycetales, Myxobacteriales, Rickettsiae, and cyanobacteria |CITS: [410379][6131881]| (see |FRAME:PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|).
The second common residue at this position is |FRAME: LYS|, but other substituition have been documented, including |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| |CITS: [4884715][14152785][6035494][6031807]|, |FRAME:LL-DIAMINOPIMELATE| |CITS: [14024243][13882624][13525638][11945321]|, |FRAME: CPD-7690| |CITS: [5870104]|, and |FRAME: 5-HYDROXY-L-LYSINE| |CITS: [16562051]|. In some cases the diamino acid in position 3 is not involved in cross linking. In these cases
the residue in position 3 can be |FRAME: N-ACETYL-L-24-DIAMINOBUTANOATE|, as in the case of <i>Clavibacter michiganensis</i> |CITS: [5704800][5119774]|, or even a monoamino acid, such as |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE| |FRAME: GLT| |CITS: [4259817]| or |FRAME: HOMO-SER| |CITS: [5119774][5119774 ][5469569]|.

Position 4 and 5 are almost always occupied by |FRAME: D-ALA-D-ALA| di-peptide. In several species enterococci and lactobacilli, the terminal |FRAME:D-ALANINE| is replaced by |FRAME:D-LACTATE| |CITS: [1503450]| or |FRAME:D-SERINE| |CITS: [8852545]|, which entails resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin.

ASCORBATE
Being a strong reducing agent, it functions as the primary water soluble antioxidant in cells, interacting with reactive oxygen species generated during oxidative stress and protecting cell constituents from oxidative damage |CITS: [    10727845]|.

Ascorbate is also a cofactor for a number of enzymes, particulariy dioxygenases, in which it maintains the reduced form of the Fe cofactor. Ascorbate-dependent enzymes are involved in many important pathways, including collagen hydroxylation, carnitine biosynthesis, norepinephrine biosynthesis, and hormone and tyrosine metabolism.

In plants L-ascorbate is also implicated in defense against pathogens and in control of plant growth and development.
A significant proportion of a plants ascorbate is found in the apoplast (the aqueous solution permeating the cell walls) |CITS: [15608627]|.

While most organisms synthesize L-ascorbate, not all do. Examples for organisms that are not able to synthesize L-ascorbate include simians and humans.

CARNITINE

Carnitine was first discovered in 1905 in muscle extracts, and the name is derived from the Latin word for flesh, Carnis |CITS: [11183736]|. In 1962 it was found that the physiological enantiomer is |FRAME: CARNITINE|, and since then the widespread distribution of L-carnitine has been established in higher and lower eukaryotes, plants, and many microorganisms |CITS: [9706218]|. 

In animals and yeast carnitine is best known for its contribution to fatty acid intracellular trafficking |CITS: [2199593]|. In plants L-carnitine is also associated with fatty acid metabolism, although its exact function is less well understood |CITS: [17988884][30080631]|. In bacteria carnitine is an important osmoprotectant, and can also enhance thermotolerance, cryotolerance and barotolerance |CITS: [25787873]|.

|FRAME: CARNITINE| is used in pharmaceutical and nutritional preparations and methods have been described for its production and separation from its |FRAME: D-CARNITINE| enantiomer |CITS: [12191705 ] [9830124]| and reviewed in |CITS: [17910757]|.

Those containing <i>N</i>-alkyl substituents have been applied successfully as herbicides.
The worldwide production of melamine, an <i>s</i>-triazine compound, in 1994 was estimated to be
900 million lb.
Melamine is most commonly used in the production of melamine-formaldehyde resins, which are
used in laminates, adhesives, fire retardants, molding compounds, coatings, and concrete plasticizers.

Melamine has become internationally recognized as a chemical contaminant of pet foods and infant formula that caused mortality in pets and children |CITS: [19109571][20049196]|.

Melamine is metabolized by soil bacteria producing the intermediates |FRAME: CPD-7399|,
|FRAME: CPD-7400|, and |FRAME:CYANURIC-ACID|, which is then metabolized to completion, producing
|FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE| amd |FRAME:AMMONIA| |CITS: [6762212]|.
MELANIN
Melanins are excellent photoprotectants due to their photochemical properties. They absorbs UV-radiation and transforms the energy into heat with minimal production of free radicals.
Common forms of animal melanins include eumelanin (the most abundant melanin in humans), pheomelanin (responsible for red hair) and neuromelanin (found in the brain). Melanins are often used for defense against different types of stresss.

MENADIOL
CPD-3766
These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.

The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lenghts, there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).
Menaquinones are synthesized by gut bacteria, and are absorbed into the blood. Thus, dietary deficiency is extremely rare in healthy individuals.

|FRAME: CPD-3766 Menadione|, also known as vitamin K<sub>3</sub>, is the most active synthetic form of the vitamin, which lacks the isoprenoid tail.

Mithramycin can also be used as an anticancer agent. In the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> cation it forms a dimeric molecule that interacts with GC-rich DNA regions in a non-intercalative manner |CITS: [1828228]|. It has been used in the treatment of testicular cancer |CITS:[14224214][7700186]|, Paget's disease of bone |CITS: [12846580]|, and other bone growth disorders, and has been used to manage hypercalcemia in patients with malignancy-associated bone lesions. It is also researched as a treatment for pancreatic cancer |CITS: [21447740][21673052]|.
Mithramycin inhibits the growth of cancer cells by cross-linking GC-rich DNA regions, thereby shutting down transcription factors (Sp1 or Sp3)-dependent pathways towards proto-oncogenes |CITS:[21543616][22545098]|, such as the |FRAME:ENSG00000136997-MONOMER| |CITS: [1827033]|, the |FRAME: ENSG00000134982-MONOMER| |CITS: [16150893]|, and the |FRAME: HS02256-MONOMER| |CITS: [12846580]|.

MORPHINE
Opium alkaloids, including morphine, are known to act as chemical defense compounds to protect opium poppy against various herbivores.

In response to stress, the capsules of opium poppies immediately metabolize morphine to dimeric morphine species, called |FRAME: CPD-12315| and |FRAME: CPD-12316|. These compounds bind to the cell wall polysaccharide pectins, resulting in cross-linking pectins to each other through bismorphine bridges and leading to resistance against hydrolysis by pectinase |CITS:[11498543][12880320]|.

Morphine is an extremely potent opiate analgesic psychoactive drug in mammals, due to its strong binding to the opioid receptors, a group of G-protein coupled receptors. It is used extensively in medicine to relieve severe or agonizing pain and suffering.

Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering.

Additional information on the nomenclature of <i>myo</i>-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document <A href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf">Nomenclature of cyclitols</A> by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication <A href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html">Numbering of atoms in <i>myo</i>-inositol</A>, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication.

To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathways (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.64"|).

Additional information on the nomenclature of <i>myo</i>-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document <A href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf">Nomenclature of cyclitols</A> by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication <A href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html">Numbering of atoms in <i>myo</i>-inositol</A>, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication.

To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathways (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.64"|).

One of the <i>N</i>-acylethanolamines, |FRAME: CPD-7598|, has received much attention because it is an endocanabinoid (an endogenous ligand of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2). However, it is a minor component of the <i>N</i>-acylethanolamines. 
The other <i>N</i>-acylethanolamines do not bind to cannabinoid receptors, but exert a variety of biological actions through several other receptors.

Two nomenclature systems have been used for the description of these ceramides. The older numbering system is based on the chromatographic migration (ceramide 1 to ceramide 8) and chronological arrangement of their publication (from ceramide 9 and on). A newer system is based on the molecular structure |CITS: [8357845][7868984]|. In this system each ceramide type is named by two or three letters, where the front letter(s) designate the acyl chain: N (non-hydroxy fatty acid), A (&alpha;-hydroxy fatty acid), O (&omega;--hydroxy fatty acid, or EO (an &omega;-hydroxy fatty acid esterified to linoleic acid), and the last letter designates the sphingoid base: S (|FRAME: SPHINGOSINE|), dS (|FRAME: CPD-13612 sphinganine|), P (|FRAME: PHYTOSPINGOSINE|), or H (|FRAME: CPD-22027|).

The 12 types of free stratum corneum ceramides are |FRAME: Ceramide-EOS| (ceramide 1), |FRAME: Ceramide-NS| (ceramide 2), |FRAME: Ceramide-NP| (ceramide 3), |FRAME: Ceramide-EOH| (ceramide 4), |FRAME: Ceramide-AS| (ceramide 5), |FRAME: Ceramide-AP| (ceramide 6), |FRAME: Ceramide-AH| (ceramide 7), |FRAME: Ceramide-NH| (ceramide 8), |FRAME: Ceramide-EOP| (ceramide 9), ,|FRAME: Ceramide-NdS| (ceramide 10), |FRAME: Ceramide-AdS| (ceramide 11), and |FRAME: Ceramide-EOdS| (ceramide 12) |CITS: [7868984][18329855][23954553]|.

<i>N</i>-acetylneuraminate, the most ubiquitous species amongst the sialic acids, is widely distributed in the
animal kingdom as a component of oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids.
<i>N</i>-acetylneuraminate carries out various biological functions by acting as receptors for
microorganisms, viruses, toxins, and hormones, by masking receptors, and by regulation of the immune
system.

N-acetylneuraminic acid is the predominant form of sialic acid present in humans. It can be found as a terminal sugar on a wide range of surface glycoconjugates |CITS: [11841250]|. The &alpha;-anomer is the form that is found when sialic acid is bound to glycans, but in solution it exists mainly (over 90%) in the &beta;-anomeric form |CITS: [18063573]|. 

A number of bacteria that can colonize humans make use of N-acetylneuraminic acid as a nutrient source. In addition, some pathogens such as |FRAME: TAX-727| use sialic acid in an immune evasion mechanism by adding N-acetylneuraminic acid to their lipopolysaccharide |CITS: [12180977][10447878]|, which provides increased survival in human serum. Most of these organisms are not capable of synthesizing N-acetylneuraminic acid and import it into the cells |CITS: [16262798]| after conversion (either spontaneous or enzymatic) to the &beta;-anomer |CITS: [18063573]| .

<i>N</i>-acetylneuraminate carries out various biological functions by acting as receptors for
microorganisms, viruses, toxins, and hormones, by masking receptors, and by regulation of the immune
system.

N-acetylneuraminic acid is the predominant form of sialic acid present in humans. It can be found as a terminal sugar on a wide range of surface glycoconjugates |CITS: [11841250]|. The &alpha;-anomer is the form that is found when sialic acid is bound to glycans, but in solution it exists mainly (over 90%) in the &beta;-anomeric form |CITS: [18063573]|. 

A number of bacteria that can colonize humans make use of N-acetylneuraminic acid as a nutrient source. In addition, some pathogens such as |FRAME: TAX-727| use sialic acid in an immune evasion mechanism by adding N-acetylneuraminic acid to their lipopolysaccharide |CITS: [12180977][10447878]|, which provides increased survival in human serum. Most of these organisms are not capable of synthesizing N-acetylneuraminic acid and import it into the cells |CITS: [16262798]| after conversion (either spontaneous or enzymatic) to the &beta;-anomer |CITS: [18063573]| .

NAD

These molecules are biological carriers of reductive equivalents (i.e. high potential electrons). Most of the time they function as cosubstrates, and in some cases they function as |FRAME: Cofactors cofactors|. They are often referred to by the obsolete term "coenzymes".

The most common function of |FRAME: NAD| is to accept two electrons and a proton (a hydride ion) from a substrate that is being oxidized. This reduction converts |FRAME: NAD| to |FRAME: NADH|, the reduced form. NADH then diffuses or is transported to a terminal oxidase, where the electrons are passed on, regenerating the oxidized form.

|FRAME: NADPH|, on the other hand, is mostly involved in biosynthetic reactions, where it serves as an electron donor. NADPH is formed by reduction of |FRAME: NADP|, which occurs by different mechanisms in different types of organisms. In photosynthetic organisms |FRAME: NADP| is reduced by |FRAME: CPLX-84|. In heterotrophic organisms it is reduced by central metabolism processes such as the pentose phosphate pathway (see |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY|).

NADHX

Studies in the 1950s have shown that |FRAME: EC-1.2.1.12|, slowly catalyzes the formation of NADHX from NADH |CITS: [Rafter54]|. The equilibrium of this hydration reaction is in favor (100/1) of the hydrated form |CITS: [3061454]|, making the reaction virtually irreversible.

NADHX and NADPHX are inhibitors of several dehydrogenases |CITS: [ 9851831]| and it is thus important to eliminate them. Reconversion of NADHX to NADH is catalyzed by an |FRAME: ENSG00000153481-MONOMER "ATP-dependent dehydratase"| |CITS:[239637][21994945]|.

Like other NSAIDs, naproxen works by inhibiting the enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.14.99.1| (also known as cyclooxygenase or COX) that converts |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| to |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2|, which is normally converted to other prostaglandins that mediate pain, inflammation, and fever. In addition, |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2| is also a precursor of |FRAME: ALPHA11-ALPHA-EPOXY-15-HYDROXYTHROMBA|, which stimulates platelet aggregation, thus the use of NSAID drugs also reduces the formation of blood clots.Naproxen inhibits both the |FRAME: HS01815| (COX1) variant and the |FRAME: HS01115| (COX-2) variant of the enzyme.

Naproxen is synthesized chemically from |FRAME: CPD-8131|. It was originally marketed under the name Naprosyn in 1976, and in the form of a naproxen sodium salt in 1980 under the trade name Anaprox. 
While it is a prescription-only drug in most of the world, it is an  over-the-counter (OTC) drug in the USA since 1994.

Naringenin

The naringenin and its glycosides content undergoes significant changes upon phytopathogen attack, and thus it appears that these compounds participate in the defense mechanism of |FRAME:TAX-2706| species and may act as fungicides |CITS: [15053528]|.

|FRAME: NARINGIN Naringin| has been investigated with respect to its ability to scavenge oxygen free radicals involved in the oxidation of hemoglobin |CITS: [12967034]|, lowering the plasma total cholesterol level |CITS: [14738906]| and blocking the cytotoxity and apoptosis of |FRAME: CPD-15099| (Ara-C), a chemotherapeutical drug used for acute leukemia |CITS: [15135655]|.

The bitterness of certain citrus species such as grapefruit (|FRAME:TAX-37656|), bitter orange (|FRAME:TAX-43166|) and pummelo (|FRAME:TAX-37334|) is caused by flavanone neohesperidosides such as naringin, in which a rhamnose is attached via the C-2 hydroxyl group of glucose. Flavanone rutinosides such as |FRAME: CPD-7059|, in which the L-rhamnose attached to the C-6 hydroxyl group of the glucose moiety, are tasteless and occur predominantly in sweet citrus fruits such as orange (|FRAME:TAX-2711|) and mandarin (<i>Citrus reticulata</i>) |CITS: [15361143]|.

Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering.

Additional information on the nomenclature of <i>myo</i>-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document <A href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf">Nomenclature of cyclitols</A> by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication <A href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html">Numbering of atoms in <i>myo</i>-inositol</A>, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication.

To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathways (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.64"|).

Neomycin was originally used as a treatment for tuberculosis, but serious side effects soon became apparent, including ototoxicity |CITS: [8170691]|, which sometimes developed to complete loss of hearing, and nephrotoxicity. Thus systemic use of neomycin is limited, and the most common mode of use is via topical application |CITS: [6224608]|.

All three antibiotics contain a 7-hydroxy-2-aminocoumarin core. The phenolic 7-hydroxyl group of the bicyclic aminocoumarin scaffold is attached to an L-noviosyl sugar moiety, while the 2-amino group is ligated to a prenylated
hydroxybenzoate unit (in |FRAME: CPD-15417| and |FRAME: CPD-15421|) or to a methylpyrroledicarboxylic acid that links two aminocoumarin moieties (in |FRAME: CPD-15504|). The noviosyl sugar is then methylated at the 4'-OH position and acylated at the 3'-OH position to produce the mature, active antibiotic.

The pharmacophore of these antibiotics is the decorated noviosyl sugar, which is presented by the planar aminocoumarin to the ATP binding site of the GyrB subunit of gyrase to interdict DNA replication |CITS: [8635474][9144789]|.

|FRAME: CPD-17212 "Nystatin A1"| is a polyene macrolide antibiotic. These compounds have 20-44 membered lactone rings containing three to eight conjugated double bonds, and interact with membrane sterols. The interaction leads to formation of polyene-sterol complexes that make the membrane permeable to water and ions, leading to cell death. Since the interaction with the fungal |FRAME: ERGOSTEROL| is much stronger than with mammalian sterols such as |FRAME: CHOLESTEROL|, the antibiotic can be used against fungal infections, with side effects developing only at high concentration |CITS: [4585230][3539192]|.

The desaturase enzymes that produce oleate have been isolated from fungi, yeast, and mammalian liver and found to be specific for |FRAME: STEAROYL-COA|. In plants, on the other hand, oleate is produced via |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs|, an acyl-carrier-protein bound intermediate |CITS: [4831331]|.

|FRAME: OLEATE-CPD Oleate| has also been reported from a few bacteria, including the obligate anaerobic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1520| and the saprophytic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1377|.

bacteria. It was initially observed in 1977 by Jean LeGall in extracts of |FRAME: TAX-145262|. The name factor 430 (F430) was coined by Gunsalus and Wolfe who reported the absorbance maximumat 430 nm |CITS: [Gunsalus78]|. The compound belongs to the corphins, a class of compounds that combine structural elements of both |FRAME: Corrins corrins| and |FRAME: Porphyrins porphyrins| |CITS: [Eschenmoser86]|.

In 1982 Ellefson et al showed that |FRAME:CPD-19766| is a cofactor of the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.8.4.1| (methyl-coenzyme M reductase) |CITS: [6954513]|. This enzyme catalyzes the final step of methane production in all methanogenic bacteria: the reduction of the methyl group in |FRAME: Me-CoM| to |FRAME:CH4|.

F430 exists in two distinct intracellular pools: either bound to methyl-CoM reductase or free of protein in the cytosol. Early literature on F430 was confusing due to reports of heterogeneity in F430 samples that depended on the isolation and purification procedures used in different laboratories. Later work showed that F430 exists primarily in two isomeric forms. These forms differ in the relative stereochemical disposition of acid side chains at positions 12 and 13 |CITS: [3356701]|.

The biosynthetic route leading to |FRAME: PWY-5196| was discovered only in 2016 |CITS: [27846569]|.

The reason for the existence of the antibodies is that the strains that do not produce PGLs produce smaller molecules that contain a similar glycosylated aromatic moiety as that of |FRAME: CPD-18579|. Two such compounds have been described from |FRAME: TAX-83332|, which does not produce PGLs: |FRAME: CPD-18617|, which contains only one modifed rhamnosyl residue, and |FRAME: CPD-18619|, which contains the full tri-glycosylated moiety as PGL-tb |CITS: [12138124]|.

Since these compounds lack the long hydrocarbon chain found in PGLs, they are released into the culture medium instead of being attached to the hydrophobic mycobacterial cell surface. It is not known whether these compounds serve any purpose for the bacteria, or whether they are produced only as an artifact due to the mutation in the |FRAME: G-15015| gene encoding the PKS15/1 synthase, which prevents these bacteria from forming the phenolphthiocerol backbone |CITS: [12138124]|.

PALMATINE

PALMITATE

The compound was discovered by Edmond Frémy in 1840 in saponified palm oil, of which it is a major
component, and was named "palmitique".

It is the first fatty acid produced during lipogenesis (fatty acid synthesis). In cells |FRAME: PALMITATE| is usually found in the form of |FRAME: Palmitoyl-ACPs palmitoyl-[acp]|, |FRAME: PALMITYL-COA| or |FRAME: Palmitoyl-lipid "incorporated into lipids"|.

|FRAME: CPD-20399 "Palmitoyl ethanolamide"| (PEA) was first isolated in 1957 from soy, peanuts, and egg yolk and described as the active ingredient in egg yolk that confers anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory properties |CITS: [Kuehl57]|. At that time egg yolks were routinely prescribed as a preventative against convalescent rheumatic fever and other Streptococcal infections |CITS: [13211905][13539486][13826312][13810795]|.

During the subsequent years the compound was consistently found in mammalian brain, liver, and muscle tissue, and its anti-inflammatory action was demonstrated in a classical anti-inflammatory model, the carrageen-induced edema model |CITS: [5699335][4729458]|, leading to its marketing in the late 60s as a medication against influenza and the common cold under the brand name Impulsin. The efficacy of this indication was verified by multiple clinical trials |CITS: [902351][392005]|.

Insight into PEA's mode of action began with the work of the Nobel laureate Rita Levi-Montalcini, the discoverer of the Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), who found that PEA is a natural modulator of hyperactive mast cells, counteracting the pro-inflammatory actions of NGF |CITS: [7505999][8931279][Hesselink13]|. Since then PEA has been found to be effective in a number of animal models for inflammation, neuroinflammation, neurotoxicity, and chronic pain.

PEA is now known to have affinity for several receptors, including the orphan cannabinoid receptors GPR55 and GPR119, the vanilloid receptor TRPV1, and the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&alpha; (PPAR-&alpha;) |CITS: [15963531][18602217][19615459][22972997]|.

Considering it was first isolated from soy, it is not surprising that PEA is produced not only by animals but also by plants |CITS: [10444099][15234550][16054175][22673881]|. Although its function in plants is still unknown, it appears to be synthesized in all organisms by very similar pathways |CITS: [24397856]|.

Paraquat is also highly toxic to mammals due to its redox activity. It is easily reduced by electron donors such as NADPH, and similarly transfers the electrons to molecular oxygen, producing superoxide.

PARATHION
Parathion, a cholinesterase inhibitor (see |FRAME: EC-3.1.1.7| and |FRAME: EC-3.1.1.8|), is extremely toxic to most animals including humans (in which LD50 is 5 to 10 mg/kg), and may cause death by inducing respiratory failure.

The active substance from the |FRAME: TAX-347426| beetles was first reported by Netolitzky in 1918 |CITS: [Netolitzky19]|. It was isolated in 1953 by Pavan and Bo, who collected 25 million |FRAME: TAX-347427| beetles for the task (and also named the compound) |CITS: [Pavan52][Pavan53]|. The structure was elucidated in 1965 |CITS: [Cardani65]|, with slight modifications and stereochemistry added a few years later |CITS: [Matsumoto68][Furusaki68]|. Two related compounds, |FRAME: CPD-22182| |CITS: [Quilico61]| and |FRAME: CPD-22183| |CITS: [Cardani67]|, were also identified in the beetles and have a similar physiological effect, though to a lesser extent.

|FRAME: CPD-21471 Pederin| is not transferred to people by biting or stinging; it is transferred when the beetle is crushed and its hemolymph contacts the skin. When contact with skin occurs, pederin causes an acute skin condition known as dermatitis linearis. The beetles are widespread, and outbreaks of dermatitis linearis have been observed in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, South America, North America and Australia.

|FRAME: CPD-21471 Pederin| is one of the most potent non-proteinaceous substances ever isolated. When injected intravenously, it is more potent than the cobra venom. It induces an acute, necrotic reaction by inhibiting protein synthesis |CITS: [Tiboni68]|, leading to arrest of DNA synthesis and cell death |CITS: [20236196]|. The toxin binds irreversibly to the ribosome, preventing translation of mRNA |CITS: [768741][Vazquez82]|. In addition, pederin has a strong vesicant activity, causing severe blistering.

The reaction to pederin is delayed 12&ndash;48 h post-exposure |CITS: [18946579][24082222][23561606]|. Subsequent scarring and hyperpigmentation are common |CITS: [5764196][18946579]|.

Similar compounds have been reported from endosymbiotic bacteria of marine sponges (the mycalamides, onnamides, theopederins, and icadamides) |CITS: [11077605]|, as well as from free-living bacteria |CITS: [28696720][29570981]|.

The compound exerts its antibiotic action against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi and protozoa, by a reaction of the electrophilic epoxylactone moiety with the active-site cysteine of GAPDH |CITS:[2930199][8286343][8204587]|. Four molecules of the antibiotic bind to each homotetramer of the enzyme.

Pentalenolactone is also a potent and specific antiviral agent, inhibiting the replication of DNA viruses, such as the

These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.

The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lenghts, there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).
Menaquinones are synthesized by gut bacteria, and are absorbed into the blood. Thus, dietary deficiency is extremely rare in healthy individuals.

Plastoquinones are found in the chloroplasts of higher plants, red, brown and green algae, and in cyanobacteria, and are important members of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, where they carry electrons from |FRAME: CPLX490-3506| to the |FRAME: CPLX-9022|. In fact, it has been shown that in cyanobacteria essentially all electron transport through unbound quinones proceeds via PQ in cyanobacterial thylakoids. Apart from PQ the only quinone found in thylakoids is vitamin K1, which is associated with PS I |CITS: [Vermaas01]|.

Plastoquinones also serve as cofactors involved in the desaturation of phytoene in the synthesis of carotenoids (see |FRAME: PWY-6475|).

Plastoquinone was isolated originally in 1946 from alfalfa, but was not identified at the time. It was rediscovered in 1959 and its structure described in the same year (see |CITS: [7022156]|).

PTM interacts specifically with the acyl-enzyme intermediate of the FabF enzyme. Crystalographic studies have shown that it binds in the malonyl subsite of FabF, with its benzoic acid ring positioned to interact with important residues of the catalytic machinery. Because of its unique mode of action, platensimycin is efficient against notorious antibiotic-resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate <i>S. aureus</i>, and vancomycin-resistant <i>enterococci</i>. PTM is not active against wild-type |FRAME: TAX-562| due to efflux mechanisms, has no antifungal activity, and has low mammalian cell toxicity |CITS: [16710421]|.

The utility of |FRAME: CPD-15302| as a drug is hampered by poor pharmacokinetic properties and negligible

It is formed post-transcriptionally from uridine by pseudouridine synthase enzymes. 

Pseudouridine is found in all species, yet its role is still enigmatic. It exerts a subtle but significant "rigidifying" influence on the nearby sugar-phosphate backbone and enhances base stacking. During translation, it is thought to modulate some of the interactions between tRNA molecules and rRNAs/mRNAs. 

The presence of pseudouridine in tRNAs results in fine-tuning the structure of the molecule, influencing its decoding activity, improving the fidelity of protein biosynthesis, and helping to maintain the
proper reading frame. The role within rRNA is less well understood |CITS: [10902565]|.

The chemical structure of pyrethrins inspired the production of a variety of synthetic insecticides called pyrethroids such as bifenthrin, permethrin, and cypermethrin

Pyrethrins are less stable and have lower toxicity than commercially synthetic pyrethroids, but are more environmentally friendly. Commercial pyrethroids are toxic to fish and other non-target organisms and thus post environmental safety concerns |CITS: [Haya89]|.

bacteria. It was initially observed in 1977 by Jean LeGall in extracts of |FRAME: TAX-145262|. The name factor 430 (F430) was coined by Gunsalus and Wolfe who reported the absorbance maximumat 430 nm |CITS: [Gunsalus78]|. The compound belongs to the corphins, a class of compounds that combine structural elements of both corrins and porphyrins |CITS: [Eschenmoser86]|.

In 1982 Ellefson et al showed that |FRAME:CPD-7425| is a cofactor of the enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase (see |FRAME: CPLX-664| and |FRAME: CPLX-668|) |CITS: [6954513]|. This enzyme catalyzes the final step of methane production in all methanogenic bacteria: the reduction of the methyl group in |FRAME: Me-CoM| to |FRAME:CH4|.

F430 exists in two distinct intracellular pools: either bound to methyl-CoM reductase or free of protein in the cytosol. Early literature on F430 was confusing due to reports of heterogeneity in F430 samples that depended on the isolation and purification procedures used in different laboratories. Later work showed that F430 exists primarily in two isomeric forms. These forms differ in the relative stereochemical disposition of acid side chains at positions 12 and 13 |CITS: [3356701]|.

The biosynthetic route leading to |FRAME: PWY-5196| was discovered only in 2016 |CITS: [27846569]|.

However, a beneficial role for rhizobitoxine has also been revealed. Rhizobitoxine production by |FRAME: TAX-29448| was shown to enhance nodulation and competitiveness in |FRAME: TAX-90550| (siratro), and |FRAME: TAX-157791| (mung beans), probably via the inhibition of ethylene production |CITS: [Duodu99][10831453]|. Thus, at least for some plants, rhizobitoxine is a nodulation enhancer rather than a phytotoxin.

Another major role of AdoMet is in polyamine biosynthesis, where it is decarboxylated by |FRAME: EC-4.1.1.50|, to form |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINAMINE|, which serves as a propylamine group donor.

AdoMet is formed by |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.6| and bears an <i>S</i> configuration at the sulfur atom. The chiral sulfonium of AdoMet spontaneously racemizes under physiological conditions to form a mixture of <i>S</i> and <i>R</i> isomers.

Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering.

Additional information on the nomenclature of <i>myo</i>-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document <A href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf">Nomenclature of cyclitols</A> by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication <A href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html">Numbering of atoms in <i>myo</i>-inositol</A>, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication.

To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathways (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.64"|).

|FRAME: CPD-8050 "<i>Scyllo</i>-inositol"| is a relatively rare form of |FRAME: Inositols inositol| but is sometimes found in organisms. It has been documented in |FRAME: TAX-13422| buds |CITS: [10830508]| and in |FRAME: TAX-4513 barley| seeds, where it is present in phosphatidylinositol |CITS: [7755633]|. The phosphatidylinositol synthase of |FRAME: TAX-5919| can act on |FRAME: CPD-8050| |CITS: [17403152]|.

A second role is in the production of a modified tRNA nucleoside (|FRAME: 5-METHYLAMINOMETHYL-2-SELENOURIDINE|). 

A third role of Se, found in some bacteria, is in |FRAME: CPD-17760|, which serves as a cofactor for some hydroxylases such as some forms of |FRAME: EC-1.17.1.5|, |FRAME: EC-1.17.99.M4|, and |FRAME: EC-1.17.1.4| |CITS: [8278371][8555176][21257770]|. Two specific proteins (YqeB and YqeC, also referred to as HP1 and HP2), whose function is unclear as yet, were predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis of this cofactor |CITS: [18289380][18510720][25638258]|.
Elemental-selenium

Elemental selenium occurs in nature in two main allotropic forms. The most stable allotrope is a polymeric form that appears as a dense purplish-gray solid. It forms polyselenides in the presence of strong reducing agents. The second major allotrope is red selenium which, similar to |FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|, forms individual molecules of eight-membered rings (although rings composed of more or less than 8 selenium atoms have been reported).

Red selenium converts to the gray polymeric allotrope upon heating.

In the CNS, serotonin is causally involved in the regulation of mood, sleep, appetite, memory and learning |CITS: [16615082]|. Modulation of serotonin at synapses is the modus operandi of several classes of antidepressants. Serotonin in the periphery is expressed in the enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal tract and regulates gut motility. Released from the enterochromaffin cells, it is taken up by platelets and plays a role in primary homeostasis and cell mediated immune responses |CITS: [19630576]|.

SIROHEME
Siroheme is found as a prosthetic group of several enzymes, including sulfite and nitrite reductases, which catalyze the six-electron reductions of sulfite to sulfide and nitrite to ammonia, respectively.
Assimilatory sulfite reductases (see |FRAME: TAX-83333| |FRAME:SULFITE-REDUCT-ENZRXN|) are found in bacteria, fungi and plants but not in animals, while dissimilatory sulfite reductases are found in diverse sulfate-reducing eubacteria (see |FRAME: TAX-879| |FRAME:CPLX-266|) and some species of thermophilic archaebacteria (see |FRAME: TAX-2234| |FRAME: CPLX-7178|) |CITS: [8994874]|.

Siroheme is also an intermediate in the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-17059| in denitrifying bacteria, and in an alternative |FRAME: Heme-b| biosynthesis pathway found in many archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria |CITS: [21969545]|.

SUCROSE
Sucrose is also found in cyanobacteria, and the ability to synthesize sucrose is a widespread feature of these organisms |CITS: [21054739]|. In addition, sucrose is produced by many nonphotosynthetic aerobic methanotrophic and methanol-utilizing bacteria |CITS: [1055047][12656177][14529181][23808151][23865613]|.

In photosynthetic organisms, the product of photosynthetic carbon fixation (|FRAME: GAP|) is transported from the chloroplast into the cytoplasm, where it is transformed to hexose phosphate by enzymes of the |FRAME: GLUCONEO-PWY gluconeogenesis| pathway. In plants, these hexose phosphates are used to synthesize sucrose, the form in which most fixed organic carbon is translocated from photosynthetic tissue to non-photosynthetic organs. Sucrose also provides substrates for plant storage glycosides such as |FRAME: Starch starch| and |FRAME: Fructans fructans|. Storage glycosides, including sucrose, are mobilized and utilized during seed germination and plant growth.

In marine and freshwater cyanobacteria sucrose fulfils a different role. It is often synthesized in response to salt or temperature stress and seems to maintain the osmotic balance and to stabilize protein and membrane structure and function |CITS: [Reed86][7854254]|. Methanotrophic and methanol-utilizing bacteria also synthesize sucrose as a secondary osmotic compound, along with the major compatible solute |FRAME: ECTOINE| |CITS: [25577257]|.

THMPT

Serving a similar role to the one that folates serve in bacteria and eukaryotes, |FRAME: CPD-10763| carries C1 (single
carbon) fragments between formyl and methyl oxidation levels (see |FRAME: METHANOGENESIS-PWY|). Despite the similarities, there are clear differences between |FRAME: THF tetrahydrofolate| and |FRAME: THMPT|. In the reductive direction, ATP is consumed in the entry of carbon from |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| into the |FRAME: THF tetrahydrofolate| pathway, but not in entry into the |FRAME: THMPT| pathway.

In the oxidative direction, methyl groups are much more readily oxidized on |FRAME: THMPT| than on |FRAME: THF tetrahydrofolate|. Moreover, the redox reactions on |FRAME: THMPT| are coupled to more negative reductants than the pyridine nucleotides which are used in the |FRAME: THF tetrahydrofolate| pathway |CITS: [10970772]|.

During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.

However, most folate molecules are further modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming
folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). Most of the glutamates are added by
&gamma;-carboxy-linked polyglutamylation via an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate
or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by
peptidases or proteases that are specific for  &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide  bonds.

The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.

The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.

|FRAME: CPD-18541 "Triostin A"| was originally isolated in 1961 |CITS: [14037700]|, and a correction to its structure was reported in 1976 |CITS: [931789]|. It was found to bind to nucleic acid purine base derivatives in a stereospecific and sequence-specific manner |CITS: [697806][6386526][3271447][11097063]|.

|FRAME: CPD-18541 "Triostin A"| is very similar to another member of this family, |FRAME: CPD-18530|, differing only in the nature of the linkage between two <i>N</i>-methylcysteine residues. While |FRAME: CPD-18541| has a simple disulfide bridge, the linkage in |FRAME: CPD-18530| contains a thioacetal bond. It has been shown that |FRAME: CPD-18541| is the direct precursor of |FRAME: CPD-18530| |CITS: [6662807][16799553]|.

It is extremely active against Mycoplasma species isolated from both mammalian and avian hosts |CITS: [14253997][4287117][3991415][8929244]|.

Like other macrolides, tylosin has a bacteriostatic effect caused by inhibition of protein synthesis through binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome |CITS: [412822][6662812][10995229][11090288]|.

Tylosin is used in veterinary medicine to treat bacterial infections in a wide range of species and is considered very safe |CITS: [13731398][13687109][17421521][4901467][4817062][3617407][8812572]|. It has also been used as a growth promotant in some species |CITS: [4758014][9988049]|, and as a treatment for colitis in companion animals |CITS: [4496763][8873399]|.

Tylosine is composed of of a 16-membered branched lactone ring (|FRAME: CPD-15957|) and three sugars, |FRAME: CPD-13969|, |FRAME: CPD-13844|, and |FRAME: Mycinopyranose| |CITS: [5500229]|.

In the case of |FRAME: TAX-208964| (and other serotype O5 strains of |FRAME:ORG-5927|), the organism possesses two types of O-antigens, which were named the A-band and the B-band. |FRAME: CPD-14608| is only found in the latter |CITS: [8112851]|. In |FRAME: TAX-520| the sugar is part of the A-band trisaccharide |CITS: [11083787]|.

This modified sugar is synthesized in an activated form as a UDP-linked sugar and is incorporated into the LPS by the action of an inverting glycosyltransferase. It is produced from |FRAME: UDP-N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| in 5 steps, catalyzed by enzymes whose genes are largely clustered in the genome. See |FRAME: PWY-7090|.

The name is derived from the Latin "ursus", which means bear, because it was originally discovered from the bile of the Polar bear (under the name ursocholeinsaure) |CITS: [Hammarsten01][Hammarsten02]|. Twenty-five years later, the compound was crystallized from a commercial preparation of bile of the Black bear, found to be an isomer of |FRAME: CPD-15189|, and named ursodeoxycholic acid |CITS: [Shoda27]|.
Bears and the nutria (|FRAME: TAX-10157|) are the only mammals in which UDCA is a dominant primary biliary bile acid, being formed by hepatic enzymes |CITS: [Tammar70][Haslewood78][Hagey92]|. In all other species it appears to be a secondary bile acid, produced by bacteria from primary bile acids |CITS: [8263415]|.

Even though UDCA is chemically synthesized by multiple companies, several countries in East Asia, including China, South Korea, Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar, still use "bile bears" - bears that are kept in captivity and used for harvesting their bile by surgery. Bear farming is extremely inhumane and many bears die of illness such as chronic infections and liver cancer. Despite being illegal in some of these countries, bear bile farming still exists in all of those countries and is a significant problem |CITS: [15066772][19138420]|.

UDCA can be 7&beta;-dehydroxylated to |FRAME: CPD-7235| |CITS: [7057103]| or epimerized to |FRAME: CPD-15189|  |CITS: [6946176]|, which is then 7&alpha;-dehydroxylated to |FRAME: CPD-7235| as described in |FRAME: PWY-7754|.

Valinomycin is formed by valinomycin synthetase, a two-protein, four-module non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) that alternatively links hydroxy acids (from <i>in situ</i> reduction of &alpha;-keto acids) and amino acids into a tetradepsipeptide intermediate, followed by oligomerization performed by its thioesterase domain, forming the dodecadepsipeptide |CITS: [24350980][30542153]|.

The anti-proliferative properties of |FRAME: CPD-7858| were discovered by serendipity. A tea made from |FRAME: TAX-4058| has been used for a long time as a folk-remedy for diabetes. When the tea was tested in a lab in 1949, it failed to show any effect on diabetes. However, when the extract was injected into rats, they died within a few days from a bacterial infection. Further research has found that administering the extract by injection resulted in a severely reduced white blood cell count and bone marrow depression. An effort to identify the active compound started in 1955, and partially enriched material was shown to possess carcinostatic activity against transplantable mammary adenocarcinoma |CITS: [13627916]|. The structure of the compound, originally named vincaleukoblastine, was reported in 1958 |CITS: [Noble58]|, and its anticancer effects were confirmed shortly after |CITS: [13719013][13842983][14407465]|.

An effort to identify the active compound started in 1955, and partially enriched material was shown to possess carcinostatic activity against transplantable mammary adenocarcinoma |CITS: [13627916]|. The first compound to be purified was |FRAME: CPD-7858|, originally named vincaleukoblastine |CITS: [Noble58][13719013][13842983][14407465]|. However, studies have shown that the plant contains more than 70 different alkaloids, and |FRAME: CPD-19894| was isolated by 1963 |CITS: [14070392]|. Vincristine was approved as an anticancer drug by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 1963.

The production of |FRAME: CPD-19894| from the |FRAME: TAX-4058| plant is very inefficient, resulting in very high prices. Initially one ton of dried leaves were used to produce one ounce of the pure compound |CITS: [1489402]|.

It was later shown to have activity not only against protists, but also against certain Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and some fungi |CITS: [9625782][18798190]|. ZmA was also reported to potentiate the activity of the toxin protein of |FRAME: TAX-1428| against insects |CITS: [Broderick03]|. The chemical structure of ZmA was initially reported in 1994 |CITS: [He94]|, and the exact stereo configuration was reported in 2007/2008 |CITS: [17249781][18798190]|.

ZmA is a very unusual molecule, and is one of only a few linear aminopolyol natural products to be identified. Its core is formed from ethanolamine and glycolyl moieties that are rarely seen in natural products, and contains an unusual 2-aminosuccinamide moiety that is derived from |FRAME: CPD-18251|. In addition, its N terminus contains a D-serine residue, even though the precursor is L-serine. Based on the current understanding of its biosynthwetic pathway, ZmA is synthesized as a larger construct that is cleaved on both sides to produce ZmA, |FRAME: CPD-18252| and |FRAME: CPD-18253| |CITS: [19098220]|.
