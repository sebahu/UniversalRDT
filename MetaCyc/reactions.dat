COMMENT - In this reaction the sensor kinase-phosphotransferase TorS undergoes 
/intermolecular transphosphorylation. The phosphoryl group is transferred from
/the histidine residue H443 to aspartate residue Asp723.
COMMENT - Sensor kinase-phosphotransferase TorS is unusual in that in addition to the 
/conserved transmitter domain, it also contains a receiver and C-terminal
/alternative transmitter domain. The autophosphorylation site, histidine residue
/H443 of the conserved transmitter domain, transfers the phosphoryl group to the
/receiver phosphorylation site, aspartate D723. This is achieved through 
/intermolecular phosphorylation between identical multimers of the complex.

COMMENT - In this reaction the sensor kinase-phosphotransferase TorS undergoes 
/intermolecular transphosphorylation. The phosphoryl group is transferred
/from the aspartate residue to the histidine 850 residue.
COMMENT - Sensor kinase-phosphotransferase TorS is unusual in that in addition to the 
/conserved transmitter domain, it also contains a receiver and a C-terminal 
/alternative transmitter domain. The receiver phosphorylation site, aspartate 
/D723, transfers the phosphoryl group to the alternative transmitter 
/phosphorylation site, histidine H850. This is achieved through intermolecular
/phosphorylation between identical multimers of the complex. The H850 
/phosphorylation site is the phosphodonor site for the TorR response regulator.
