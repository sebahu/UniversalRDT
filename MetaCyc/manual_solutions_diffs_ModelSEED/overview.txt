6PGLUCONOLACT-RXN	O	MetaCyc	MetaCyc probably right
DAHPSYN-RXN	O	RDT	MetaCyc is now changed to the same mapping as RDT
DIOHBUTANONEPSYN-RXN	C,O	MetaCyc	Manually curated in MetaCyc, with evidence from literary
F16ALDOLASE-RXN	C,O,P	Unclear	Changed symmetry, both reasonable, no literary evidence
FARNESYLTRANSTRANSFERASE-RXN	C,O,P	Unclear	Both involve the "move" of a C=C double bond, opposite result to RXN-11018
HISTAMINOTRANS-RXN	C,O	MetaCyc	In MetaCyc it is an exchange of O vs Amino, RDT uses different/symmetric C atom
IMIDPHOSDEHYD-RXN	O	MetaCyc	Two changes in RDT vs one in MetaCyc
IMPCYCLOHYDROLASE-RXN	O	MetaCyc	Two changes in RDT vs one in MetaCyc

RXN-7770	C,O	Unclear	Different C-C bond is opened
RXN-8442	C,O	RDT	In RDT it is an exchange of O vs Amino, MetaCyc involves more atoms
RXN-9140	C,O	RDT	In RDT it is an exchange of O vs Amino, MetaCyc involves more atoms
RXN-9196	C,O,N	MetaCyc	MetaCyc is just one replacement, RDT is an insertion
